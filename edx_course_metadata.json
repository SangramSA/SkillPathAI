    "course_description": "How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?\nRemote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.\nRemote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.\nIn Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to \u201crelaunch\u201d your team\u2014focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive\u2014while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.\nRemote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley\u2019s book\u2014 The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere. Praise for the book includes:\n\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives.

But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.\n\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself--the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.\nWhat's more, \"The Science of Happiness\" offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.\nThe course's co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They'll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude--experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.\nConsider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track. Join the conversation on The Greater Good Science Center Facebook page, or in the BerkeleyX: GG101x The Science of Happiness Facebook group.\nThis program is offered in collaboration with edX, which is an online program manager (OPM) company.

Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.\nModern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.\nAgile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.\nData science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.\nWe\u2019ll teach you the paradigms, processes, and introduce some key technologies that make the data-driven product organization the optimal competitor in the market.",

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation.\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life -- agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.\nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.\nThe course's instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.",

    "course_description": "About the Database Series of Courses\n\"Databases\" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. \nRelational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.\nAll of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.\nWhy Learn About Databases\nDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",

During this critical time, strategic interventions can ensure children have a strong foundation to lead healthy, productive lives as engaged citizens.\nThere is an urgent need to increase access to high-quality early childhood development intervention programs on national and global scales. While the science behind the importance of early development and funding for these programs has increased globally, policy development, research, and implementation best practices have not been widely adopted. As the COVID-19 virus disrupts health, nutrition, childcare, and education services, and stretches social and child protection systems to their limits, children and families least able to cope are being hit hardest with inequities in childhood development widening. Evidence-based policies that support families and young children are needed now more than ever. This course examines best practices in child and family policies, advocacy, financing, and pathways to scale\u2014showing you how to generate an innovative, scalable intervention strategy that supports early childhood development. ****\nThe course begins with a review of basic early childhood development concepts and successful implementation programs around the world.

In order to present an argument that will clearly communicate your perspective, you must first understand the basic structure of any argument and develop your logic and critical thinking skills.\n\n\nIn Structure and Function of Argument: Introduction to Critical Thinking, you will engage in dynamic practice exercises to develop the ability to recognize, analyze, and construct arguments you encounter on a daily basis. You will consider the structure of an argument, focusing on the underlying organization of claims and reasoning. You will determine if the reasons support the author or speaker\u2019s main claim, build well-constructed responses, and grow your overall English language skills. You will also test your listening skills by recognizing how things like logical fallacies, conflicting points of view, and controversial subjects can impact effective communication.\n\n\nUsing a tool called \u201cargument mapping,\u201d you will visually diagram the structure of an argument to identify how reasons connect and function in an argument. You will then apply your learnings and test your own arguments using this tool \u2013 allowing you to gauge the overall quality of your arguments and take steps to make them stronger.\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have built a toolkit to engage in more constructive conversations and to actively listen to better understand others\u2019 points of view.",

Scrum is employed by over half of all Agile practitioners across all industries. While agile may have started in software development, many industries now use an agile methodology to deliver their work. The basis for agile, the agile manifesto, extends well beyond its origins in extreme programming and agile software development. Development teams around the world are now using kanban boards and assigning strong product owners to direct self-organizing teams to deliver on prioritized product backlogs. And nearly every new product has some sort of IT component and goes through an agile development lifecycle.\n\n\nToday nearly 100% of IT organizations use Agile and many other industries are quickly following;\n\n\nThe likelihood of being on a Scrum or Scrum-like project is quickly approaching 50/50 or better over time.\n\n\nWhile the Mastering Agile Professional Certificate program emphasizes principles at the heart of all Agile frameworks, in this course we start by learning the key project management processes, roles, mechanics, and philosophies behind Scrum. This will provide the basis for all understanding Agile in its purest form over four weeks exploring Why, Who, How, and finally What Scrum looks like applied in the real world. From understanding the agile team members, like scrum master and product owner, to the important differences in lean and agile processes.\nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how scaled agile is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to begin your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on \u201cSprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery.\u201d\nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

    "course_description": "One of the key insights from the science of happiness is that our own personal happiness depends heavily on our relationships with others. By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged\u2014and more productive and innovative\u2014workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.\nThis course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and \u201cemotional intelligence,\u201d also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.\nDrawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management\u2014managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days\u2014to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just \u201csoft\u201d skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.\nWhat\u2019s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively\u2014with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.\nThe course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide. Here they take a central insight from that course\u2014that our personal well-being is entwined with our social connections\u2014and explain how to apply it to the modern workplace to create more productive, satisfying experiences at work. \nThis program is offered in collaboration with edX, which is an online program manager (OPM) company. The roles and responsibilities of the OPM partner in the offering of the program are to provide the learning platform for the delivery of academic content, technical support for said platform, marketing support for the courses and programs, and creation of any credentials earned by the learner.

    "course_description": "About the Database Series of Courses\n\"Databases\" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. \nRelational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.\nAll of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.\nWhy Learn About Databases\nDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",

But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can\u2019t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? \nEnergy Within Environmental Constraints won\u2019t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. \nThis course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won\u2019t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? \nThis course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance. \nPhoto credits: \nSolar Farm CC-BY Michael Mees on flickr\nSmokestack CC-BY Patrick on flickr",

In this hands-on, introductory course, you will examine all the forms in which data exists, learn tools that uncover relationships between data, and leverage basic algorithms to understand the world from a new perspective.\nWhether you're a high school student or someone switching careers, all you need to get started in this course is a curiosity about the topic of machine learning and a willingness to tinker around with your computer.\nThe course is taught by modules. Within each module, you'll have access to videos, short exercises, and a final capstone project. In Module 1, you'll begin by looking at different kinds of data. To help you explore the data, you'll dive right into some programming with the Python programming language. You don't need to have any programming background, we will guide you on how to leverage Python to explore and visualize any data.\nOne kind of data you'll work with is data that relates one variable to another. Coming up with a relationship between two variables\u2014one depending on the other\u2014is at the center of Module 2. In that module, you'll build up some core concepts before seeing your first machine learning algorithm. The goal is to use programming to create models that describe mathematical relationships between data. You'll be able to see how good the model is and use it to make predictions about new data.\nIn Module 3, you'll see a discussion about where imperfections in collected data might come from. You rarely have perfectly \u201cclean\u201d data sets, so it's important to understand how imperfections impact the model that an algorithm might come up with. To this end, we will introduce the notion of data distributions and build up to the concepts of biased and unbiased noise.\nAnother kind of data you'll work with is data that belongs in different groups (or classes). Creating a model that predicts what group data belongs in is at the center of Module 4. You'll work through different ways of thinking about this problem and see three different ways of approaching making such groupings (classification).",

However, rapid urbanization and population growth place multiple pressures on solid waste management systems, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the urban poor are most affected by lack of access to basic SWM services, such as waste collection and disposal.\nYet, the sector also provides numerous opportunities: Improving solid waste management provides a cleaner and healthier environment; improves livability for all city residents; and attracts new investment and tourism, which improve a city\u2019s economic competitiveness, creating jobs, and new business opportunities. SWM also contributes to new sources of energy thus tackling climate change challenges. In these ways, SWM is directly relevant to the World Bank\u2019s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.\nHistorically, the highest expenditures of local governments is in the SWM sector but \u2013 particularly in low- and middle-income country cities \u2013 the bulk of expenses goes towards collection and transport instead of treatment and disposal. Another challenge is ensuring the financial sustainability of SWM projects and cost recovery once SWM infrastructure has been created. The world is generating increasing amounts of waste, with large amounts (primarily plastics) ending up in the oceans. However, there is also a paradigm shift from thinking about waste as something to be disposed \u2013 \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d \u2013 to a resource that can be used for energy generation, reduce the use and costs associated with virgin resources, and improve our climate change efforts.\nGiven this background, this e-learning course is designed to look at the SWM sector, with a focus on MSW, from several angles in order to simplify concepts and promote understanding of this sector.",

It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. \nThis process is a critical step for any data scientist.

    "course_description": "Causal diagrams have revolutionized the way in which researchers ask: What is the causal effect of X on Y? They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.\nThe first part of this course is comprised of seven lessons that introduce causal diagrams and its applications to causal inference. The first lesson introduces causal DAGs, a type of causal diagrams, and the rules that govern them. The second, third, and fourth lessons use causal DAGs to represent common forms of bias. The fifth lesson uses causal DAGs to represent time-varying treatments and treatment-confounder feedback, as well as the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment. The sixth lesson introduces SWIGs, another type of causal diagrams. The seventh lesson guides learners in constructing causal diagrams.\nThe second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the health and social sciences.\nProfessor Photo Credit: Anders Ahlbom",

We detail how the analyst develops information about the relative strength of the bulls and the bears through price charts and other tools.\nPrice charts are one of the primary tools of technicians. Charts provide a history of market action and analysts can observe patterns in the chart. As early as the 1930s, analysts determined that certain patterns tended to precede certain price moves. This course reviews those patterns, discusses how to identify the patterns and supplements this with concepts form behavioral finance to explain why the patterns are predictive. Different chart types are presented and important charting concepts are explained from a practical perspective.\nIn addition to charts, technical analysts also use indicators and various theories to forecast the direction of prices through the study of past market data.\nWe focus on defining and applying momentum indicators to make buy and sell decisions. Instead of simply explaining and illustrating popular indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD and stochastics, we review historical back tested results of each indicator so that you can objectively evaluate their performance.\nIndicators based on the sentiment of various groups are analyzed and breadth indicators are explained.\nIn addition to indicators, theories applicable to trading are studied.\nFree Preview!

    "course_description": "Have you ever wondered about how museum, library, and other kinds of historical or scientific collections all come together? Or how and why curators, historians, archivists, and preservationists do what they do?\nIn Tangible Things , you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.\nBy \u201cstepping onto\u201d the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard\u2019s astonishing array of tangible things\u2014books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century \u201cspirit writing\u201d chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau\u2019s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.\nIn the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard\u2019s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you.\nIn the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.\nFinally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.\nAlong the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "course_description": "Agile can often challenge project managers in the realm of leadership. Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential? \nInstead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means.\nGreat leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader. \nIn this course, you will learn how this new style of leadership redefines and redistributes team roles by: \n\n\nMotivating through empowerment to gain better decisions\n\n\nFacilitating the creativity and inclusivity of a high-functioning team\n\n\nIdentifying and managing decision making biases\n\n\nNegotiating conflicts across individuals, teams, and organizations\n\n\nEnsuring success through delegation and powerful constraint-based metrics.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll learn to turn one internally motivated and critically thinking mind into many; and driving speed and innovation through leveraging all talents on the team.\n\n\nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on Agile Process, Project, and Program Controls. \nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Often, though, we do not have a clear sense of what would make us happy. For more than thirty years, psychologists studying positive psychology have asked this very question: What makes people happy? And the research they have undertaken has provided clear answers.\nIn this course, you will learn about the field of study known as positive psychology, which is the scientific study of \u201cvalued subjective experiences\u201d such as happiness, well-being, satisfaction, hope, and optimism, as well as positive traits such as creativity, courage, and wisdom that contribute to meaning in life. Positive psychology focuses on the psychological states \u2013 contentment, happiness, and hope \u2013 individual traits \u2013 intimacy, creativity, integrity, altruism, and wisdom \u2013 and social institutions \u2014 schools and places of worship \u2013 that enable us to live our best life.\nIn this course, you will learn about the history of positive psychology, beginning with the work of William James, continuing through the theory and research of contemporary positive psychologists. There is extensive coverage of the factors that determine our happiness, subjective well-being, and life satisfaction. Learners are given ample opportunities to engage in the activities that research has shown provide valuable self-care, including expressing gratitude, helping others, engaging in mindfulness, and finding meaning.\nLater in the course, we present cross-cultural research on how well-being is measured across different societies and countries, cultural differences in desired levels of happiness, and how policy informs these factors. Last, research has demonstrated that helping others contributes to our levels of happiness. This course explains the factors that influence why we help, when we help, and how to increase helping behavior.\nThe course has a dual focus; in addition to learning about the field of positive psychology and its research findings, you will learn what proactive steps you can take to boost our own levels of happiness, well-being, and life satisfaction.\nContributors\nEditorial Advisors\nDr. Susan A.

There is an acute global shortage of health workers, a gap that will grow to 18 million by 2030. Studies show that training high-performing community health workers can help close these gaps and save more than 3 million lives annually.\nIn the past few decades, many community health worker programs across the world have demonstrated their ability to save lives \u2014 including in the hardest-to-reach areas. Yet despite this progress, lessons on how to successfully scale these programs as part of national primary health systems are not widely shared.\nThis course, developed in collaboration with the Community Health Academy at Last Mile Health, introduces learners to the core concepts of community health worker programs, and explores what is needed to build and strengthen large-scale programs in order to improve access to high-quality health services. The curriculum highlights the key components of designing community health systems, addresses common management challenges, and showcases lessons learned from a range of contributors \u2014 from community-level practitioners to government leaders and other global health experts. Through case studies of exemplar countries (including Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Liberia), participants will learn from leaders across the globe how to advocate for, build, and optimize community health worker programs.\nThis course was created by health systems leaders for health systems leaders. Whether you work in a Ministry of Health, lead or support a community health worker program, mobilize resources and advocate for increased investment in community health, or you are simply interested in knowing what it takes to deliver quality care through community health worker programs, learners will have the opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills to implement critical change. This course can be taken individually, but learners are also encouraged to convene their colleagues from within or across organizations to share insights and further enhance the learning experience.\nAbout the Community Health Academy\n Last Mile Health launched the Community Health Academy in 2017 to revolutionize training for community health workers and health systems leaders. The Academy is equipping current and next-generation health systems leaders to build strong community health systems through university-quality courses that are delivered virtually and in-person through coaching, mentorship, and group discussion. The Academy is also supporting Ministries of Health to enhance the effectiveness of their health worker training by deploying mobile phones equipped with high-quality digital content to frontline and community health workers.",

Students will learn a method for recognizing and analyzing how religious ideologies are embedded in all arenas of human agency and not isolated from political, economic, and cultural life as is often assumed. \nIn addition to examining the conflicts themselves, we will also explore the religious dimensions of the impacts those conflicts have on civic life in areas such as public health, education, and commerce by addressing a series of questions. \n\nWhat roles do religions play in fostering violence and what roles do they play in promoting peace?\nHow do religious institutions and ideologies function to support and/or thwart public health initiatives?\nWhat are the ideological justifications for functional economic policies and how do they reflect and/or challenge diverse religious values?\nWhat roles do religions play in advancing or suppressing educational opportunities and for whom?\nAre media representations of the religious dimensions of conflict accurate?\n\nPossible countries of focus include Brazil, Egypt, France, Israel/Palestine, Myanmar, Nigeria, Qatar, the Philippines, Somalia, Syria, Turkey, and the United States. Final projects will be individually shaped based on interest and (where relevant) professional focus. \nThe course is open to all and especially relevant for aspiring or professional educators, journalists, public health workers, foreign service officers and government officials who wish to better understand how religions function in contemporary world affairs. \nThis course follows the popular World Religions Through Their Scriptures XSeries, which explores the foundations of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism.",

    "course_description": "Human rights have been defined as a concern of the international community since the post-Second World War period, when the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the prohibition of discrimination were included among the objectives of the newly established United Nations. They have significantly expanded their reach since: they now influence various branches of domestic law, including family law, employment law, corporate law, or criminal law. They also have influenced the shaping of international relations, in areas such as development cooperation, foreign debt, the global fight against terrorism, or the quest for sustainable development.\nGovernments remain the main actors in the development of human rights. Civil society (non-governmental organisations) and social movements, however, increasingly contribute to shaping their contours, and human rights are now evolving as a result of the constant dialogue between international human rights bodies and domestic courts, in a search that crosses geographical, cultural and legal boundaries. This course will explore how human rights evolve and how they can be enforced and progressively realized. It will examine the sources of human rights, including both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. It will address the specific regime of human rights law as part of general international law. It will relate the rights of individuals to the duties of States (to respect, protect and fulfil human rights). And it will assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms of protection of human rights, at both domestic and regional or international levels. \nThe course relies extensively on comparative material from different jurisdictions, to study a wide range of topics including, for instance, religious freedom in multicultural societies, human rights in employment relationships, economic and social rights in development, the human rights responsibilities of corporations, or human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism.",

    "course_description": "Economic concepts often give a fresh and unobvious perspective when applied to the study of how the state, law, and the economy functions and are interrelated. This course teaches students essential economic concepts in an intuitive manner relevant to the study of political economy. Part One of the course is focused on developing the essential economic concepts. These are then applied to the study of the nature of the liberal democratic state and why it has to be a limited state in contrast to a populist democratic one. \nTopics include the contractual nature of the state, public versus private goods, property rights and economic externalities, the logic of collective action, social choice theory, agenda control, the art of manipulation, and the compatibility of two ideas of liberty with the democratic state. \nThe use of interdisciplinary materials, empirical inference, game theoretic simulation, and cross-referencing with political philosophies and well-known historical cases, provide students an opportunity to connect different perspectives and deepen their understanding of the democratic state in a free society using economic concepts. \nThe economic concepts developed in Part One of the course will continue to be useful in the other three parts. Part Two covers the nature of the authoritarian state and party rule, rent seeking activity and its economic consequences, and interrelationships between democracy and economic growth. Part Three covers rule of law and their legal origins, consequences of legal origins for growth, law or state as determinants of economic growth, and transition from dictatorship to democracy and their permanence. Part Four is a study of nature of politics in pre-industrial states with examples drawn from China, Europe, the Islamic world, and India. We also discuss the relevance and limitations of the economic approach to the study of law and politics. \n\u4ee5\u7d93\u6fdf\u6982\u5ff5\u7814\u7a76\u570b\u5bb6\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u7d93\u6fdf\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8207\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u95dc\u806f\u6642\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u9bae\u4f46\u4e0d\u660e\u986f\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u3002 \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ee5\u8207\u653f\u6cbb\u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u76f4\u89c0\u65b9\u5f0f\u6559\u6388\u5b78\u751f\u57fa\u672c\u7d93\u6fdf\u6982\u5ff5\u3002 \u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u4efd\u8457\u773c\u65bc\u767c\u5c55\u57fa\u672c\u7d93\u6fdf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7531\u6c11\u4e3b\u570b\u5bb6\u7684\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u5b83\u5fc5\u9808\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u570b\u5bb6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u570b\u5bb6\u3002 \n\u4e3b\u984c\u5305\u62ec\u570b\u5bb6\u7684\u5951\u7d04\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u8207\u79c1\u4eba\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u8ca1\u7522\u6b0a\u548c\u7d93\u6fdf\u5916\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u96c6\u9ad4\u884c\u52d5\u7684\u908f\u8f2f\uff0c\u793e\u6703\u9078\u64c7\u7406\u8ad6\uff0c\u8b70\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u64cd\u7e31\u85dd\u8853\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c11\u4e3b\u570b\u5bb6\u7684\u5169\u7a2e\u81ea\u7531\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002 \n\u8de8\u5b78\u79d1\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7d93\u9a57\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u535a\u5f08\u8ad6\u6a21\u64ec\u4ee5\u53ca\u8207\u653f\u6cbb\u54f2\u5b78\u548c\u8457\u540d\u6b77\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53c3\u7167\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u5229\u7528\u7d93\u6fdf\u6982\u5ff5\u5c07\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u806f\u7e6b\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u52a0\u6df1\u5c0d\u81ea\u7531\u793e\u6703\u4e2d\u6c11\u4e3b\u570b\u5bb6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002 \n\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u4efd\u6240\u8ac7\u53ca\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4e09\u500b\u90e8\u4efd\u4ea6\u6703\u8ac7\u53ca\u3002 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u4efd\u7814\u7a76\u5a01\u6b0a\u570b\u5bb6\u548c\u653f\u9ee8\u7d71\u6cbb\u7684\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u5c0b\u79df\u6d3b\u52d5\u53ca\u5176\u7d93\u6fdf\u5f8c\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c11\u4e3b\u8207\u7d93\u6fdf\u589e\u9577\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002 \u7b2c\u4e09\u90e8\u4efd\u5305\u62ec\u6cd5\u6cbb\u53ca\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6df5\u6e90\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6df5\u6e90\u5c0d\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u570b\u5bb6\u4f5c\u70ba\u7d93\u6fdf\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f9e\u7368\u88c1\u5230\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u904e\u6e21\u53ca\u5176\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u3002 \u7b2c\u56db\u90e8\u4efd\u662f\u5c0d\u6210\u70ba\u5de5\u696d\u570b\u5bb6\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u6027\u8cea\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u4f86\u81ea\u4e2d\u570b\uff0c\u6b50\u6d32\uff0c\u4f0a\u65af\u862d\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u3002 \u6211\u5011\u9084\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u5f9e\u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8207\u653f\u6cbb\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002",

In order to deliver effective care, the technician requires the knowledge of different aspects of biology and engineering. The different devices work in so many different ways and the literature about repair and troubleshooting is often hard to come by. It can be quite frustrating to search for solutions every time the operator encounters a problem. There is added pressure because the availability of medical devices is critical for therapeutic and diagnostic care. The longer a device stays out of operation, the slower the hospital would be able to deliver care to the patients.\nThis course has been designed by the interdisciplinary collaboration of both TU Delft biomedical engineers as well as the local expertise of the medical technicians of the Nick Simons Institute in Nepal to help new and emerging biomedical engineers/technicians working in low-income hospitals to care for biomedical equipment.\nThis course provides a compilation of the techniques hospitals use to effectively maintain and troubleshoot the medical devices so that repair time is reduced and the availability and safety of the medical devices is improved. Completing this course adds a complementary skill set to prior competence of the learner to perform maintenance routines and diagnose problems in sophisticated equipment with care. A faster service routine will help smoothen the process flow of the hospital and help extend the care to more patients. On a personal level, the learner can rely on the knowledge gained from this course as \u2018the blueprint\u2019 for whenever they have to maintain/troubleshoot any medical device. \nAccredited Course\nThis course is accredited by the Dutch Association for Specialists in Sterile Medical Tools (VDSMH).

Many decisions seem straightforward\u2014when to wake up, what to eat, what to wear, what activities to do\u2014but research suggests that even simple decisions are influenced by other people and by the context in which the decisions are made. More significant decisions such as who we befriend, who we choose as a long-term partner, and what career we pursue are similarly influenced by psychological factors. ****\nThis course will separate the varied psychological factors that affect decisions into several categories. Some psychological factors are intrapersonal, meaning they occur in our own mind. These include cognitive factors such as schemas and attributions, and motivational factors such as the influence of psychological needs. Other factors are interpersonal, acknowledging that other people have powerful influences on our decisions. Another section focuses on the unique influence of group dynamics, suggesting our decisions are influenced by conformity, groupthink, and group polarization. Finally, we cover intergroup influences on decision making, such as prejudice and discrimination.\nThe goal of this course is to introduce you to the many psychological influences on decision making. Knowing more about the psychological factors underlying decision making will help you make more informed decisions and help you analyze how other people make decisions and the factors that contribute to those decisions. If you are an employee, this course can help you understand how your supervisor makes decisions and how you can affect those decisions.

The meaning behind this message is that as leaders of programs and projects, we need to be not just communicators, but effective communicators.\nObtaining your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or similar project management certificate is the first step. But, as you gain program management and project management experience, you realize that effective communication goes beyond what you learned in \"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge\" (PMBOK). \nGaining a program management certification or project management certification (such as the PMP certification) equips you with the necessary project management tools to begin your project or project management career. There is more to effective program and project communication than what is on the PMP exam.\nFor communication from program managers and project managers to be truly effective, there must be understanding beyond what you learned from your professional certification. The communicator and the receiver must use feedback to determine how the message was received and if the communicator created the intended level of understanding in the receiver for the communication to succeed.\nIn this course, you will learn about the Understanding Triad - know-what, know-how, and know-why. The Understanding Triad aids you in crafting just the right level of explanation for all your audiences. The Understanding Triad will make you a more effective program manager, traditional project manager, agile project manager, or certified scrum master.\nThe Project Management Institute, Inc (PMI) teaches that project management communication is the transfer of information. The project or program manager sends messages to their project teams, stakeholders, customers, and executive sponsors. If the program manager or project manager believes that communicating a clear message is enough for good communication, then the manager may be fooled into thinking their communication efforts are complete. Even if there is feedback, the feedback is usually limited to confirming that the message was received as intended. However, communication is not merely the transmission of information. The difference can be days, months, or years of wasted time and effort; or successful, early delivery.\nCertified program and certified project managers earn 10 professional development units (PDU) as they learn how communication can make a difference in every interaction, and become a truly effective program or project manager.

    "course_description": "How healthy is the state of the economy? How can economic policy help support or restore health to the economy? These questions are at the heart of financial programming. In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions.\nFinancial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy.\nIn Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF's Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.)\nDuring the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you.\nWhether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey!\nFinancial Programming and Policies, Part 1 is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Japan.",

Clinical trials, the hallmark of medical research, are expensive to perform, and take place primarily in countries which can afford them. Around the world, the blood pressure thresholds for hypertension, or the blood sugar targets for patients with diabetes, are established based on research performed in a handful of countries. There is an implicit assumption that the findings and validity of studies carried out in the US and other Western countries generalize to patients around the world.\nThis course was created by members of MIT Critical Data, a global consortium that consists of healthcare practitioners, computer scientists, and engineers from academia, industry, and government, that seeks to place data and research at the front and center of healthcare operations.\nBig data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. The world is abuzz with applications of data science in almost every field \u2013 commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms. This course provides an introductory survey of data science tools in healthcare through several hands-on workshops and exercises.\nWho this course is aimed at\nThe most daunting global health issues right now are the result of interconnected crises. In this course, we highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to health data science. It is intended for front-line clinicians and public health practitioners, as well as computer scientists, engineers and social scientists, whose goal is to understand health and disease better using digital data captured in the process of care.\nWe highly recommend that this course be taken as part of a team consisting of clinicians and computer scientists or engineers. Learners from the healthcare sector are likely to have difficulties with the programming aspect while the computer scientists and engineers will not be familiar with the clinical context of the exercises and workshops.\nThe MIT Critical Data team would like to acknowledge the contribution of the following members: Aldo Arevalo, Alistair Johnson, Alon Dagan, Amber Nigam, Amelie Mathusek, Andre Silva, Chaitanya Shivade, Christopher Cosgriff, Christina Chen, Daniel Ebner, Daniel Gruhl, Eric Yamga, Grigorich Schleifer, Haroun Chahed, Jesse Raffa, Jonathan Riesner, Joy Tzung-yu Wu, Kimiko Huang, Lawerence Baker, Marta Fernandes, Mathew Samuel, Philipp Klocke, Pragati Jaiswal, Ryan Kindle, Shrey Lakhotia, Tom Pollard, Yueh-Hsun Chuang, Ziyi Hou.",

This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.\nThese big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.\nWe will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?\nThis course will be is relevant for anyone eager to have a framework for good decision-making. It will be good preparation for students with a bachelor's degree contemplating graduate study in a business field.\nOpportunities in analytics are abundant at the moment. Specific techniques or software packages may be helpful in landing first jobs, but those techniques and packages may soon be replaced by something newer and trendier.

    "course_description": "Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience. \nHowever, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as: \n\n\nTransparency with daily standup meetings discussing work status, risk, and pace.\n\n\nHow a clear definition of done drives acceptance by all key stakeholders.\n\n\nMeasuring performance and benefits of working solutions during project delivery.\n\n\nIteratively testing to gain authentic feedback on solution requirements and stability.\n\n\nRegular retrospectives that drive continuous improvement into the team.\n\n\nHow agile project management ensures success and uniquely tackles business risk\n\n\nQuality management principles to reduce project risk and technical debt\n\n\nManage and reduce interdependencies between project teams to scale programs at speed\n\n\nMaking the business case for agile contracts and how they ensure deliverables achieve business outcomes and objectives\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.\nThis shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career. \nSo how do programs ensure smooth project delivery? \nThis answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it\u2019s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes. \nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope either completes your certificate with us or takes you to one of our most popular courses in the series, \"Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.\"\nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

These are then applied to the study of the nature of the liberal democratic state and why it has to be a limited state in contrast to a populist democratic one.\nTopics include the contractual nature of the state, public versus private goods, property rights and economic externalities, the logic of collective action, social choice theory, agenda control, the art of manipulation, and the compatibility of two ideas of liberty with the democratic state.\nThis MOOC is Part Two. Part Two provides an in-depth exploration of the political and economic factors that influence power dynamics, governance, and growth across various political systems. Spanning four weeks, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of authoritarian rule, one-party governance, and their economic consequences. Additionally, the course will delve into the implications of rent-seeking behavior and examine the factors that contribute to the rise and decline of nations.

No one wants to do research that can\u2019t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists. \nTo meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery. \nThis course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. \nWe\u2019ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. \nConsider this course a survey of best practices: we\u2019d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it\u2019ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues.

    "course_description": "About the Database Series of Courses\n\"Databases\" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. \nRelational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.\nAll of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.\nWhy Learn About Databases\nDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",

The first part covers robot modelling. Kinematics of robot manipulators is derived using a systematic approach based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and the use of homogeneous transformations. \nThe inverse kinematics problem is analyzed and closed-form solutions are found for typical manipulation structures. The Jacobian is then introduced as the fundamental tool to describe differential kinematics, determine singular configurations, analyze redundancy, derive the statics model and even formulate inverse kinematics algorithms. \nThe equations of motion of a robotic system are found on the basis of the dynamic model which is useful for motion simulation and control algorithm synthesis. Two approaches respectively based on Lagrange formulation and Newton-Euler formulation are pursued.",

Some weeks will examine the physics concepts, while others will see excerpts of films or discuss modernist poetry that took off from relativity. Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein\u2019s works. At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example.\nTypically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

Program and project teams and leaders, need to understand what matters and how their work connects to the greater whole.\nStorytelling is not a part of the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI) \"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' (PMBOK). Storytelling is not something that Certified Associate In Project Management (CAPM), Project Management Professional (PMP), PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP), certified scrum masters, or other certified project manager credential holders will encounter on an exam. Storytelling is something that successful program or project managers learn from years of experience. If storytelling is not on the PMP exam or similar project management certification exams, why should you bother learning how to tell good stories?\nBecause, human brains are naturally designed for stories. We have brain structures devoted to making sense of the world in cause-effect terms. Good stories are like flight simulators in that you can try out various approaches to a problem before tackling the real problem. Risk management for programs and projects is more effective when using compelling narratives. Stories are also effective ways to transmit large amounts of information to your project teams and stakeholders. People can remember more information and act effectively on that information. For agile project management, stories are how customers communicate their requirements to the agile project team. Stories are the foundation of persuasive communication and will help you become an expert communicator.\nIn this online course of the Program Management and the Art of Communication certificate program, you will learn how great program and project managers use their storytelling skills to create compelling project visions, persuade stakeholders, and design effective risk management strategies.\nEarn 10 professional development units (PDUs) while completing the only professional certification program that helps you develop storytelling as part of your collection of project management tools.",

If you have hundreds of thousands of books available to you in an instant, where do you even start? With a bit of elementary code, you can study all of these books at once, and derive new sorts of insights.\nComputation is changing the very nature of how we do research in the humanities. Tools from data science can help you to explore the record of human culture in ways that just wouldn\u2019t have been possible before.

    "course_description": "Innovative products and services change lives, and having the right innovative process creates an competitive advantage. Ultimately, innovation is about one thing: problem solving.\nAs an agile problem solver, you'll need to expand your critical thinking skills to address the key sources of risk in developing best solutions for your new products and business lines. The Problem-solving techniques covered begin with problem definition, beginning with job descriptions and applying the right soft skills to enhance requirements gathering. This ensures you're targeting a good problem to solve, and that you understand the business model. The course then moves on to practices such as \"brainstorm and storm drain\" to target new creative solutions. You will learn how innovation works on fast feedback cycles to test possible solutions and target root causes of defects. Creative thinking isn't a straight line, and neither should the problem-solving process be a straight line. Each course of action needs early and frequent testing.\nKey lessons taught in this course are:\n\n\nDelivering business value, not technical scope with User Stories\n\n\nWhy innovating is the key to risk management and gaining a competitive advantage\n\n\nThe best innovation process for startups in new markets or disruptive innovations, versus sustaining product and process innovations\n\n\nHow to employ an innovation process that fits your business model and situation\n\n\nUsing Cross-functional teams and user stories to gather accurate requirements\n\n\nLeveraging constraints to apply tested solutions to new technology and new innovations\n\n\nApplying Test-Driven Design (TDD) to deliver better designs with less designing\n\n\nBy following best practices of Agile, including timeboxes, constraint-based thinking processes, and empathetic problem solving, you'll learn how to provide a sustainable innovation environment for your teams.\nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile innovation is accomplished in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on \u201cAgile Leadership Principles and Practices.\u201d\nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

    "course_description": "Stress, anxiety, and burnout are rampant across workplaces today: 80 percent of workers feel stress on the job, and nearly half say they need help learning how to manage it. While many organizations may assume that intense stress is unavoidable, even admirable, research suggests that too much stress is toxic to our health and performance, leading to burnout and harming the culture of organizations as a whole.\nThis course offers research-based strategies for building resilience to stress and fortifying our well-being in the face of challenges. It explains the biological and psychological impact of stress, helps you distinguish between harmful and helpful forms of stress at work, and provides strategies for handling stress in healthy and productive ways.\nThe course zeroes in on the practice of mindfulness, the moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, and sensations that comes without judging those thoughts and feelings as good or bad. In recent years, there has been a surge in scientific research on mindfulness, with many studies documenting the value and advantages of fostering mindfulness in workplace settings. This course covers the landscape of mindfulness science, explains why it\u2019s relevant to modern workplaces, and describes how it can be effectively folded into your workplace, drawing on case studies from several major companies that have implemented their own mindfulness programs.\nThe course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, introducing a half million students worldwide to research-based practices of mindfulness and related skills of stress reduction. In this course, they tailor their scientific insights to the needs of the modern workplace, highlighting stories of success from trailblazing organizations while also identifying challenges that workplaces may face as they try to foster mindfulness and resilience. \nThis program is offered in collaboration with edX, which is an online program manager (OPM) company. The roles and responsibilities of the OPM partner in the offering of the program are to provide the learning platform for the delivery of academic content, technical support for said platform, marketing support for the courses and programs, and creation of any credentials earned by the learner.

This shift enabled an unprecedented economic convergence, the age of GVCs, wherein low-income countries grew rapidly and began to catch up with high-income countries.\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis, however, the growth of trade has stagnated and the expansion of GVCs has stalled. These trends have only been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, threats to the model of trade-led growth have emerged. Technological change could draw production closer to the consumer and reduce the demand for labor. And trade conflicts among large countries\u2014exacerbated by conflict around COVID-19\u2014could lead to a retrenchment or a segmentation of GVCs.\nHow can GVCs power sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development? How can countries work together to create deeper reforms and predictable policies that encourage shared and sustained GVC participation? How can the development of GVCs continue amid the COVID-19 crisis?\nThis MOOC gives participants an opportunity to explore trading for development- how GVCs can further boost inclusive and sustainable economic growth, creating better jobs and reducing poverty. Economists from across the World Bank Group will discuss how GVCs impact a range of development issues. Participants will also benefit from using a global online platform, by networking with peers across the world, experimenting with digital visualizations about GVCs, and experiencing the interconnectedness of global development demands.",

Listen to Graham Allison, Martha Crenshaw, David Holloway and Joe Martz as they investigate the evidence with myself and selected Stanford students. What would be the consequences of a nuclear terror attack? The scenario is difficult to imagine, but Alex Wellerstein and Lynn Eden help me and our students understand just what could happen if the worst case occurs, and how we can work to limit the damage. What can we do to prevent or mitigate this risk? Participate as I explore this crucial question with the help of Stephen Flynn, Rachel Bronson, Valerie Plame Wilson, Ellen Tauscher and Jeffrey Lewis.\nWith the expert help of Stanford Online, we are able to bring to you this unprecedented group of experts from a wide variety of fields, who share a strong commitment to the urgency of educating people on this important topic. In some of the sessions, you will also hear students actively participating in the conversation. You\u2019ll be exposed to a profound and sometimes disturbing body of research and information, and challenged to find a path forward out of this predicament.\nWe do not have required reading, but under Additional Resources you will find numerous books, articles, web links and videos to enhance your experience. In addition, we offer a \"Nukes in the News\" section to add topicality. The more you participate, the more you will get out of your experience.\nOur course differs from most online courses in a fundamental way: our goal is not just to provide facts, but to inspire you to take action. You have the power to make a difference, and I believe this course will give you knowledge and hopefully motivation to do so. You can read more about the subject, and find ways to become involved, by visiting the website of the William J. Perry Project: www.wjperryproject.org.",

The importance of nutrition on global health is demonstrated in the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 as set by the United Nations General Assembly, as nutrition is considered a cornerstone for 12 out of 17 of these goals. Nutrition has a positive effect on health as well as on economic growth.\nClinical nutrition described as the basic interdisciplinary and applied science that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and management of nutritional and metabolic changes related to acute and chronic diseases for both patients in healthcare institutions or those who receive care periodically as outpatients, is an old concept but the importance is hardly recognized.\nAiming to emphasize the importance of clinical nutrition, this course equips you with evidence-based insights and practical know-how on nutrition-related solutions. By providing you with this information, the course broadens your conceptual knowledge towards the context & background-independent application of nutrition-related issues due to chronic and infectious disorders.\nOur evidence-based practice approach will allow you as a decision-maker to identify the relevant evidence for practice while taking into account the sociocultural background and wishes of a patient. This evidence-based practice approach will eliminate the \u2018trial & error\u2019 approach in favor of better health outcomes and originates from North and South countries.\nThis course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in clinical nutrition, dietetics, endocrinology, and gastroenterology. The instructors are teachers/lecturers and researchers in these fields at universities in Europe (KU Leuven, Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism) and in Africa (Stellenbosh University, Division of Human Nutrition; University of Ghana, Department of Nutrition and Dietetics; University of Rwanda, School of Public Health, and University of Zimbabwe, Institute of Food and Nutrition) which is the uniqueness of this course.\nBy being able to apply the evidence-based practice of clinical nutrition in different situations you will be able to function as a linking pin between research and practice with experience from North & South countries. Such profiles align strongly with the future outlook of nutrition-related needs as reported by organizations like the World Food Programme, World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, and International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThis MOOC was created with the support of the KU Leuven Faculty of Medicine",

Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.\nIn this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.\nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on \u201cAgile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills.\u201d\nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Your willingness to experiment with new teaching practices is all that is required. \nThe strategies presented in this course are adapted from Artful Thinking pedagogy, developed by Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. You will explore three thinking dispositions, using eight thinking routines that are easy to understand and implement with STEAM curricular content. \n\nStarting with the disposition of observing and describing , you will learn how to guide your students in slowing down, using their senses, and communicating impressions of what they see in a work of art...and in other things.\nNext, the routines used in the disposition of reasoning with evidence ask students to make hypotheses about the art and support their arguments with observations.\nFinally, the questioning and investigating disposition challenges students to hone their natural curiosity by expressing their wonderings and formulating open-ended questions.\n\nThroughout, you will discover the power of art to develop your students\u2019 inclination, motivation, and ability to think deeply. \nWhen you enroll, all the resources you need for your classroom to strengthen critical thinking by using art will be immediately available. We recommend spending a few hours learning and practicing each section before progressing to the next. \nThe online course environment features over 20 videos and interactive tools: \n\na zoom tool to examine works of art at full resolution\npolls to compare your thoughts with those of other participants\ndiscussion boards where teachers around the world share ideas, plans, and results\nauthentic lesson demonstration videos that model routines led by real classroom and museum educators with students of varying ages, with corresponding downloadable lesson plans\ninterview videos on topics like using thinking routines with emerging language learners and making accommodations for all learners\n\nParticipating with a global network of educators who, just like you, want to hone their abilities to teach critical thinking skills and explore arts integration will be an added bonus to your course experience.",

A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the nonlinear data structures and algorithms.\nYou will explore the hierarchical data structure of trees. Trees have important properties such as shape and order which are used to categorize trees into different groups and define their functionality. The course begins by explaining Binary Trees and two subgroups: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Binary Heaps. You will program BSTs, their operations and traversal algorithms. BSTs are an important structure when wanting to access information quickly. Heaps approach access differently and prioritize what data is accessed. Heaps also employ the concept of up-heap and down-heap operations not found in other structures.\nHashMaps and SkipLists are the last data structures discussed in the course. The HashMap ADT is a collection of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are stored in an unordered manner based on hash codes and compression functions that translate keys into integers. You will investigate different collision strategies and implement one. SkipLists are a probabilistic data structures where data is placed in the structure based on a randomization procedure.\nThe course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.",

    "course_description": "In this course you\u2019ll learn various statistics topics including multiple testing problem, error rates, error rate controlling procedures, false discovery rates, q-values and exploratory data analysis. We then introduce statistical modeling and how it is applied to high-throughput data. In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.\nThese courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:\nData Analysis for Life Sciences:\n\nPH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences\nPH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra\nPH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments\nPH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis\n\nGenomics Data Analysis:\n\nPH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor\nPH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics\nPH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor\n\nThis class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.",

In 2015, the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These interconnected Goals aim to end poverty and promote economic prosperity, ensure social equity, and protect the environment. Above all, the 2030 Agenda commits to \u201cleaving no one behind.\u201d How do we know if we are on track to achieve the SDGs? Which Goals should different countries prioritize? And what kind of data do we need to ensure that everyone is counted?\nLaunched in 2015 by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Stiftung, the Sustainable Development Report is the first worldwide study to assess where the world stands with regard to achieving sustainable development. The Report contains the SDG Index and Dashboards, which use a combination of official and unofficial data and indicators to understand each country\u2019s progress on the 17 SDGs.\nIn this short course, you will hear from some of the experts responsible for creating the Sustainable Development Report about the value of measuring progress on the SDGs, and how a tool like the SDG Index and Dashboards helps policymakers and other stakeholders make important decisions about their development priorities. You will examine the different types of data that can be used to measure development progress, and learn the technical steps needed to construct an index for the SDGs. Finally, you will explore regional and city-level indices, and discuss new approaches to SDG measurement and data-based decision-making.",

Early reading success is the best predictor of later reading achievement, which in turn is closely linked to educational success and healthy wellbeing. How can you as educators, parents or family members, help support children to develop a strong foundation of skills that are critical for early reading success? How can you best support struggling readers to be successful?\nAcross languages, research has shown that children\u2019s knowledge of the sound structure of their spoken language (phonological awareness) is critically important to early reading and spelling development. The ability to learn new words efficiently, or vocabulary growth, is also vitally important for children to understand what they are reading. Quality shared reading experiences in the early years is a great way to foster the development of these skills.\nThis course provides a research-to-practice learning experience for professionals and parents interested in the reading development of young children. This course will ensure that teachers and professionals alike are reading books in the most effective way to support children\u2019s early reading skills. The course content will be relevant for all young children, specifically focusing on the key foundational skills of phonological awareness, print concepts, and vocabulary knowledge for children aged 4-6 years. The course will also include a focus on preventing the persistent word decoding problems associated with dyslexia for children with familial risk, and children with other challenges to learning to read, such as speech and language difficulties.\nAs part of completing the course, students will be given access to a large set of online children books, especially designed to foster phonological awareness and vocabulary development.\nPlease note, completion of this free online course is not equivalent to any Better Start Literacy Approach microcredential.

Already in biblical times, and continuing until this very day, what happened and happens in Jerusalem is a focus of interest worldwide. In this course, we will learn about the history and archaeology of ancient Jerusalem, from its earliest beginnings in the late Prehistoric Periods (ca. 5th millennium BCE) and until the Muslim conquest of the city in the 7th century CE. We will cover the main finds and periods during this long time span, including the periods relating to the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the Christian Bible/New Testament, and periods including the Bronze Ages, the Iron Age (1st Temple Period), the Persian, Hellenistic and Early Roman Periods (2nd Temple Period), and the Late Roman and Byzantine Periods. We will discuss the geography, history and archaeology of the city, and its place in the broader geopolitical and religious contexts, visit major archaeological sites situated in the city and its surroundings, and meet and talk with leading researchers in the field of history and archaeology. Studying the history and archaeology of ancient Jerusalem not only will enlighten us about the city itself but serve as an excellent basis to learn about the methods of history and archaeology, and the history and archaeology of the Land of Israel/Southern Levant in the periods that we will survey. As Jerusalem is such a magnet of interest for so many people throughout the world, of various cultures, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, we believe that the course will be of deep interest, and relevance, for many.

Sustainably sourced timber can store carbon, both in forests and in buildings.\nTimber is also an ideal material for prefabrication, which allows us to shift the bulk of construction labor to manufacturing halls and make the building process itself cleaner, quicker, of a higher quality, and less of a nuisance on-site.\nAdditionally, an ideal timber construction process should incorporate circular building practices allowing us to re-use timber structures at individual building and regional level.\nOverall, when compared with traditional construction based on heavy abiotic materials, this will result in healthier buildings which store carbon instead of emitting it, while the raw resource grows back in sustainably managed temperate forests.\nThis course is relevant for all stakeholders in the built environment \u2013 architects, developers, engineers, consultants and policymakers \u2013 as well as students who want to learn more about the opportunities and cutting-edge best practices for designing and building with timber.\nThis course has been developed by TU Delft\u2019s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment and the Circular Built Environment Hub, in collaboration with VIA University College Denmark, FSC Netherlands, the AMS Institute, Ssse | OvO associates architects, Lister Buildings, Material District and geWOONhout in the context of the HOME for the future project.\nCo-founded by EU.\nLIFE20 GIE/NL/001073 - LIFE timber in housing\nViews and opinions expressed are however those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Union or CINEA.

    "course_description": "Digital systems have revolutionized our world. From television to cell phones to GPS to warfare to automobiles to medicine to distance education, computers and digital processing have reshaped the way we live and work. The semiconductor industry has grown from $21B in 1985 to $412B in 2019, making it one of the largest sectors of the economy. Computers are also a vital part of daily practice in every field of science and engineering.\nPrevious generations of engineers learned the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of the profession by doing hand-on projects such as disassembling and rebuilding engines. As technology has advanced, cars have become too complicated for the average person to work on. Ironically, the same advances have made computers much easier to build. While most fields of engineering require extensive mathematics and complicated analysis of even rather simple components, digital systems merely require counting from 0 to 1. Their challenge, instead, is in combining many simple building blocks into a complex whole. In this class, you will experiment with digital systems, building simple circuits from logic gates on a breadboard and designing more complex systems with a logic simulator. You will learn how to systematically create digital systems with a desired function. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and experience to design digital systems and be prepared for more advanced coursework.\nBeyond the practical reasons to take this class, I hope you find it enormously fun and exciting like I do. There's a great satisfaction about being able to build things. Digital systems are ideal because the components are far cheaper and easier to use than in other engineering fields. It's also amazing to demystify how digital systems work under the hood. I fell in love with digital design when I first studied it in college, and I hope you do too!\nThis is the first half of a 2-part sequence. This half covers digital design. The second half, ENGR85B, covers computer architecture, where you will learn to program, use, and build microprocessors. By the end of the second half, you will have designed your own microprocessor and understand it all the way from the transistor level to the software. You'll also have built smart gadgets and games with lights and sensors.",

The program has been endorsed by the Israeli Medicine Association and Ministry of Health. Here, we present a condensed online course that includes selected topics chosen from the extended program. \nThis GaBI course on edX presents clinicians and digital health enthusiasts with an overview of the data revolution in medicine, and how to take advantage of it for research and in the clinic. In the scope of this single course, you will not become a bioinformatician, but you will be able to familiarize yourself with the main concepts, tools, algorithms, and databases used in this field, and understand the types of problems that these analysis techniques can help address. \nThe syllabus covers the main topics of this discipline in a logical order: \n\u25cf Methods used to obtain medical data (genotypic and phenotypic) \n\u25cf Analysis of biological molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins using various computational tools from the field of bioinformatics \n\u25cf Use of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to mine the huge databases of medical information accumulating in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), the Web, and numerous data science projects in medicine \n\u25cf Analysis of complex interaction networks between DNA, RNA and protein molecules to gain a more holistic and systematic view of biological systems and medical conditions \n\u25cf Practical applications in the clinic and in personalized medicine research, and the use of cutting edge technology to improve health",

From envisioning a product strategy to correctly portraying the product roadmap, the process must be inclusive, interactive, and motivating with modern leadership techniques. As your products grow, you\u2019ll also need to skills to manage teams of teams. This course will enable you to align product teams, product designs, and product development for speed and innovation at scale.\nProduct Managers have one of the toughest, most demanding positions in the modern product organization. They must be both visionaries and evangelists, as well as facilitators and coaches. Often they must communicate clearly and effectively across a wide range of audiences. To do this well means being the expert in a number of key competencies of leadership.\nModern leadership principles emphasize empowerment and ownership. Meanwhile products require teams to work together at scale. This course will starts by resetting on what is good leadership based on actual data and studies. Not half-proven theories or intuition. Drawing on actual research and met studies we\u2019ll cover the key elements of what makes a good product leader based on work by Jim Collins John Maxwell, Peter Northouse, Melissa Perri, and more. One of the key findings is that a leader\u2019s success is driven by their team, and how well that team aligns with the mission. Understanding this, we\u2019ll show you how to maximize the team\u2019s effect on the leader and vice versa.\nNext we\u2019ll dive into how to build the team. This is essential if you want to move the culture and practices of your organization to truly thrive. We\u2019ll also go over principles of encouraging ownership and continuously replenish your leadership pipeline.\nIn the third week, we\u2019ll look at the core influential competencies of a product evangelist. This means vision setting, roadmapping problems, setting goals and objectives, demoing effectively and more. We\u2019ll also discuss the art of negotiating across departments and interests, and how to manage conflicts to resolution quickly through good leadership and problem solving.\nFinally we\u2019ll turn to frameworks for organizing teams at multiple scales of product development. Whether an aspiring product manager or Head of Product, this will enable better understanding of how leaders align teams. Starting with basic Agile processes we\u2019ll move on to scaling techniques for integrating hardware and software teams of teams.

    "institution": "The University of Hong Kong",
    "course_description": "Multiple experts from across faculties at The University of Hong Kong and professionals engaged in gender-related developments in Asia will address the ways in which gender is understood, constructed and performed. Drawing from a variety of perspectives \u2013 cultural studies, economics, education, law, linguistics, psychology, public health, politics, social policy, and sociology - we begin by questioning meanings of gender in different cultural settings and historical moments. What do the representations of our currently used categories such as man, woman, transgender, queer, cisgender, bisexual, or intersex mean in different contexts? How are conversations about gender taking place in Asia and how do they converge or diverge from those happening elsewhere? \nThe course is a comparative, interdisciplinary and cross-sector conversation which encourages reflective thinking about practices of gender. It courts and questions the fixity of language, traditions, laws, and practices as well as the resilience of stereotypes, biases, and structures which perpetuate myths, hierarchies and discrimination. \nUnraveling the interlinkages between these conversations and categories equips you with the skills needed to identify, recognize and reject outmoded or biased constructions of gender as well as the power hierarchies these embed within social relations. We will examine why gender equity is so important and yet hard to achieve. We scrutinize social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects the gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding gender and its relations with society, we look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence. \nAdditionally, as digital technology plays an ever-increasing role in contemporary construction of social realities of people, the course looks into how, if at all, these networked communities offer new expressions of gender as performativity and the ways in which these replicate, reproduce or refashion traditional gender categories and roles. \nThen we turn to challenge our everyday practices of gender and how they colour our approaches, assumptions, and biases (conscious and unconscious) about the \u2018other\u2019? The course invites scrutiny of the practice and performance of gendering self and others. At the same time, it is a reminder that gender is not just about identity but also about power. The course examines manifestations and causes of gender inequality and its inextricable link to structural and institutional forces of discrimination. To better understand the interaction between identity and power, we look at gender-based violence. The #metoo movement has exposed not only the depth and scale of violence but also unmasked the asymmetries of power. Power and privilege are enjoyed by a select group while the voices of others remain invisible and ignored. \nWe conclude by looking at local, national and global efforts to address gender disparities in society in various domains. We invite you to reflect on the course materials and to connect them to your daily life. How can your new understandings about gender generate a ripple of change around you?",

This course will provide you with an in-depth exploration of fa\u00e7ade detailing, with a focus on a stick fa\u00e7ade system. This entails deciding on the system, the material and the connection between the fa\u00e7ade and the building in the design process. Get it wrong and the fa\u00e7ade will leak or worse still, break!\nWe are going to do it in a thorough and practical way. You will be guided step-by-step through the development process of fa\u00e7ade details using an example. You will gain knowledge of detailing, stick systems, and the materials available for these systems. You will learn to interpret fa\u00e7ade details, and draw the typical details of a stick-system fa\u00e7ade, which will demonstrate your understanding of how the various fields impact the design. While we focus on only one type of fa\u00e7ade system, our aim is to provide you with enough confidence to begin applying structural, building physics, and construction concepts to the detail drawings of other fa\u00e7ade systems.\nThe course is developed for (aspiring) architectural engineers who seek more information about, and practice with, fa\u00e7ade detailing. Here we understand the detailing process as the individual technical design development of an engineer, composing various technical solutions to fulfill various functions of fa\u00e7ades. Before beginning this course, learners should have a background in architecture, structural engineering, or similar field.",

The growing amount of evidence that substantiates the importance of this link indicates it is a valuable area for the improvement of human well-being and more understanding and research is needed.\nThe brain is the control centre of the body, and it is heavily influenced by the food we eat. The quality and quantity of our diet can affect our cognitive abilities, mood, and overall brain function. Our brain can also impact our eating habits, by controlling our appetite, cravings, and decision-making processes.\nA diet that is high in processed foods, saturated fats, and added sugars can have negative effects on brain function and can lead to inflammation, stress, and insulin resistance, all of which can impair cognitive abilities, memory, and learning. \nSolution\nTo overcome the lack of knowledge in the complex relation between food, gut and brain, and how it can affect life in many senses, EIT Food has developed this short online course to enable not only healthcare professionals, but anyone that is interested in the subject, to understand and discuss how the food we eat can optimise brain function and overall health.\nThis course title is \u201cFood for Thought: Relationship Between Food, Gut and Brain\u201d. It is composed of 20 hours of learning broken down in 5 modules.\nOn this course, you will look at the relation between the brain and the digestive system and will be able to describe the role that a diet has on brain function. You will reflect on the possible causes of unhealthy and pathological eating behaviours and assess the relationship between emotions and food intake. You will also discuss the relationship between the food they eat, the digestive system, the brain and how this affects their daily life.\nAmbition\nOur mission is to provide awareness about the interplay between brain, food and gut and empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to improve their overall well-being by understanding this correlation. Through EIT Food online course, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the latest research and insights into the food-gut-brain connection not only for health care professionals, but for any individual that could be interested in how they influence physical and mental health.\nHigh level contributors\nThis course has been designed for anyone with an interest in the subject but may be of particular interest to psychologists or people working in health and well-being, and has been produced by the University of Turin, with content provided by the University of Hohenheim and the Polish Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research.",

You\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You\u2019ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. \nYou\u2019ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You\u2019ll learn three views of the user\u2019s role in interface design: the behaviorist \u2018processor\u2019 view, the cognitivist \u2018predictor\u2019 view, and the situationist \u2018participant\u2019 view. You\u2019ll discover how these different views of the user\u2019s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you\u2019re considering what goes on inside the user\u2019s head, as well as in the environment around them. \nYou\u2019ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You\u2019ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. \nYou\u2019ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing. You\u2019ll learn the limitations of human sensing and memory and how we must be aware of the cognitive load we introduce on the user while using our interfaces. Cognitive load can have an enormous impact on a user\u2019s satisfaction with an interface, and must be kept in mind as you begin your career as a designer. \nYou\u2019ll finally conclude with an overview of the major design principles in human-computer interaction. Curated from the work of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Ronald Mace, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood, these design principles cover revolutionary ideas in the design of interfaces: discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, constraints, error tolerance, and more. These principles are crucial whether you move forward as a designer, an evaluator, a front-end engineer, or any other role in technology design. \nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll have an understanding of where HCI sits in the broader field, a grasp of the goals of HCI, and a foundation in core principles that inform interface design.",

    "course_description": "This course introduces the elements involved in the design of psychological research. To produce reliable, valid results that can be used to understand psychological processes, researchers must take great care in how they define and measure variables, how they sample groups of individuals from the populations of people or animals that they are interested in, how they control extraneous variables in the research setting, and myriad other factors. Psychologists can choose from an array of research designs, including observational, correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental methods. And depending on the design, they must consider the many factors that affect the reliability of those observations and the validity of any conclusions that might be drawn from them. This course considers all these and many other aspects of psychological research. A large segment of this course is then devoted to issues related to how psychologists ensure that the research methods they employ are ethical. Everyone would agree that ethical considerations are one of the most important things researchers must think about when they plan their studies, but it\u2019s also one of the most invisible in reports on psychological research. Any article that reports the results of a psychological study provides voluminous details about the methodology, about issues like sampling and validity, for instance, but little if any mention of the relevant ethical issues, even though there are ethical issues in play at every step of the process. Behind all the fascinating research in the psychological literature are rules, regulations, and expectations about how the people or animals we study will be treated, and about how the data we collect will be analyzed and reported. And behind all those standards are more general principles that have been established from grim experience that includes some of the worst things humans have ever done in the name of science, and other missteps that hindsight tells us we don\u2019t want to repeat. In this course, we investigate that history and abstract from it those principles that now guide ethical decisions about how to do research. To what goals do those principles aspire?

    "course_description": "How can we ensure the continuous supply of the increasingly scarce raw materials that are needed to make the products we use every day? In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.\nA good number of the materials found in everyday products are now referred to as \"critical\". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance.\nMany metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.\nInnovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.\nScarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.\nThis course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.\nThis course has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT receives support from the European Union\u2019s Horizon2020 research and innovation program.",

The answers are complex. They require precise theoretical and practical knowledge of national, regional and international law.\nThe 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees will enable you to master these questions. This Convention remains the cornerstone of international refugee protection. It is at the heart of this online course. You will analyze in detail the principle of non-refoulement, the definition of a refugee and the causes of persecution such as political opinion, race, nationality, religion or membership of a social group.\nThis definition will allow you to identify the people who, legally, should be recognized as beneficiaries of refugee status and international protection. Using a conceptual tool, the three-scale theory , you will analyze in a rigorous and structured manner each distinct element of the refugee definition (persecution, risk, proof) as well as, in a comprehensive approach, the definition as a whole.\nBy confronting theoretical analysis with practical situations, you will see that, if correctly interpreted, the Geneva Convention remains effective and still allows to this day the protection of many fugitives or refugees ( Fl\u00fcchtling, r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s ).\nBeyond law, you will understand the value of an interdisciplinary approach, in particular when measuring the credibility of an asylum seeker\u2019s narrative.\nYou will examine the importance of regional, subsidiary or complementary protection in addressing armed conflict, events seriously disturbing public order or mass influxes of people in need of international protection. Regional protections find their source in European Law, African law or American Law.\nFinally, you will look at future challenges, such as the issue of climate refugees.\nNumerous sources will be provided throughout the course in order to help you understand the concepts such as relevant case-law, doctrine and guidelines of UNHCR and other international institutions on refugee issues and international human rights law (such as EASO).\nIn this course, Asylum and Refugee Law, you will learn whether or not migrants can be returned to another country, whether or not they should be included in or excluded from the refugee definition, and whether or not to challenge the decision on someone\u2019s refugee status.

    "course_description": "Machine learning classification and regression techniques have potential uses in various engineering disciplines. These machine learning models allow you to make predictions for a category (classification) or for a number (regression) given sensor data, and can be used in, for example, predicting properties of objects (such as their weight or shape).\nUsing hands-on and interactive exercises you will get insight into:\nMachine learning and its variants, such as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nRegression techniques such as linear regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, how to deal with outliers and evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).\nClassification techniques such as the histogram method, the nearest mean (or nearest medoid) method and the nearest neighbor classifier. We cover the classification setting and important concepts such as the Bayes classifier and the Bayes error, the optimal classifier in theory.\nTraining models using (stochastic) gradient descent and its variants, we learn how to tune this optimizer, and how to use it to construct a logistic regression classification model.\nOverfitting means a classifier works well on a training set but not on unseen test data. We discuss how to build complex non-linear models, and we analyze how we can understand overfitting using the bias-variance decomposition and the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we discuss how to evaluate fairly and tune machine learning models and estimate how much data they need for an sufficient performance.\nRegularization methods can help to mitigate overfitting. We discuss two regularization techniques for estimating the linear regression coefficients: ridge regression and LASSO. The latter can also be used for variable selection.\nClassifier evaluation metrics such as the ROC curve and confusion matrix can give more insight into the performance of classifiers. We also discuss what constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d accuracy; this is given by so-called dummy-classifiers which are na\u00efve baselines.\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) are more advanced classification models that can provide good performance even in high-dimensional spaces and with little data. We discuss their different variants such as the soft-margin SVM, the hard-margin SVM and the nonlinear kernel SVM.\nDecision Trees are simple models that can easily be understood by lay people. They are easy to use and visualize, and instead of a black box they can be easily understood as an interpretable white box model, making them suitable for various applications.\nThe lectures feature a unique combination of videos mixed with hands-on interaction with machine learning algorithms to stimulate a deeper understanding. In the exercises you apply the algorithms in Python using scikit-learn and in the final project you will further deepen your understanding of the various concepts by building and tuning a machine learning pipeline from start to finish.",

    "course_description": "Every program and project has a social world. The program managers, project managers, project teams, and stakeholders mutually agree on roles and interact based on those roles. \nGreat program managers sense, manage, and influence the social worlds across their projects. They bring order and understanding through conflict management and conflict resolution. Success is not guaranteed, and often teams clash as a new social order is established on every project. They heal divides that can grow under the stress of projects and increase the team\u2019s problem solving ability. \nDr. Pearce, the inventor of the Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM), explains the social world as a \u201cdance between the two faces of the communication process: coordinating actions and making/managing meaning. A social world is the site where speech acts, episodes and forms of communication, selves and forms of consciousness, and relationships and minds are made.\u201d\nOur cultural differences and emotions significantly shape our social worlds. \nThe program and project manager with good emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence (EI/CI) can better understand and navigate the social worlds of the project team and the stakeholders. High EI/CI also aids in creating understanding in program/project management communications. A program manager or project manager with high EI/CI is more adept at creating understanding because they are self-aware while understanding other\u2019s emotions.Thus, the program manager or project manager can test if the recipient of his or her communication has the requisite know-what, know-how, and know-why understanding of the intended messages.\nProgram managers and project managers with high EI/CI will be perceived as having a high ethos. Team members will see the high emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence even in the manager\u2019s nonverbal communication. Being more aware of our feelings and other people\u2019s feelings helps enhance our connection to others and make us more credible. Program managers and Project managers with high EI/CI can use pathos more effectively and make the logos portion of their communication more effective. The right balance of ethos, pathos, and logos makes the project manager more persuasive.\nAlong with increasing the program manager or project manager\u2019s EI/CI, this course will aid the manager in using the tools of CMM. Dr. Pearce created Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) in the mid-1970s. Over the years, CMM practitioners have created methods and tools to make the communication perspective visible. One such tool is SEAVA, which is an acronym for Storyboarding, Enriching, Analyzing, Visioning, and Acting. You can use the SEAVA tool to examine communication problems among your project team members and to generate a solution.\nUnderstanding the different social worlds of your program and its project team members and stakeholders will help you create persuasive communications, have a positive impact, and increase understanding among the project team members and stakeholders. CMM will help you become a master of communication and persuasion.",

Planning requires a firm knowledge of a commodity\u2019s future market in terms of supply and demand, its value or forecast price, the capital outlay (development costs) and the costs to produce it and, critically, how the development of that deposit will be funded. This funding may take the form of equity, debt or potentially derivative or convertible instruments or through other innovative funding mechanisms such as metal streaming, farm-ins and participation funding (joint ventures).\nWe will also look at the number of people either directly or indirectly linked to the mining business, with the multitude of stakeholders ranging from employees, service providers, financiers and investors through to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and activists.\nThroughout the course we reference the value-chain which represents the stages and processes that a minerals project will go through to produce mineral products.

It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. \nRelational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.\nAll of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.\nWhy Learn About Databases\nDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",

But how does the 'invisible hand' of economics show up in practice? What determines electricity prices and why are they always changing? Why is it so difficult to encourage investment in electricity generation?\nThis course will help you understand the functioning of energy markets as the necessary first step to promotion of the energy transition. By using the European electricity market as an example, you will obtain a deeper understanding of its principles and effectiveness.\nYou will investigate four main areas:\n\nthe basics of the energy markets;\nthe operation and design of those markets;\nhow policy makers can promote investment in electricity generation;\nhow the electricity network operates and how network tariffs are determined.\n\nInsightful videos will explain the driving factors behind energy markets. Interactive assessments will demonstrate how the merit order is chosen for different types of markets and how this determines the market price. Live practice sessions will take you through the auctions and marketplaces where electricity trading takes place today, giving you invaluable knowledge on the inner workings of these markets and the effects of network capacity.\nWhether you are interested in learning about how the merit order in energy markets works or how the European electricity market is organized; or interested in understanding the economics behind electricity consumption, examining the economic problems of incorporating renewable energy sources into the current system; or simply want to become informed about what makes the energy markets tick -this is the course for you.\nThis course will address all of these questions and more. Upon completion of the course, you will be able to take on questions, problems or challenges thrown at you about the nature of energy markets and their operation.\nThis course is the first course in the program: The Economics of the Energy Transition. This program aims to help strategic decision makers, economists, policy advisors and regulators as well as practicing and future engineers to obtain a deeper understanding of the topic.

A risk plan is the way to lessen the chance of adverse outcomes.\nThe project risk management plan is the fundamental instrument for identifying elements and activities of project risk management, establishing risk breakdown structures, quantifying the extent of risk, and planning a mitigation strategy.\nThe initial step in planning for project risk management is developing the risk register. A risk register is a detailed inventory of things that could go wrong. The risk register provides a plan to follow the project through completion.\nAssigning probabilities and consequences to the many items in the risk register is in itself challenging. Contemporary lessons from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics provide insights into how to do so.\nFinally, the project manager must consider the best responses to risk including how to avoid, mitigate, plan contingencies, or transfer the risk.

    "course_description": "We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called \"regular languages.\" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.\nOur second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.\nNext, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called \"recursively enumerable languages\"). We shall learn how \"problems\" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be \"decidable\" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and \"undecidable\" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.\nLast, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.",

    "course_description": "This course aims at acquainting you with the modeling and simulation of complex articulated mechanical systems, denoted as multibody systems, such as vehicles, merry-go-rounds, motorbikes, cranes, human bodies, suspensions, robot manipulators, mechanical transmissions, etc.\nThis course is based on (1) video clips focusing on the main theoretical background and concepts, (2) well-illustrated written sections giving more details about the mathematical formulation, and (3) questions, exercises and modeling projects.\nDespite the intrinsic complexity of such systems in terms of morphology and motions, basic skills in Newtonian mechanics, linear algebra and numerical methods are sufficient to model them, provided that the endless and tedious computation related to their internal kinematics and dynamics are at our disposal. This is the purpose of the symbolic program ROBOTRAN*, which can be used with this course and can automatically generate the full set of equations of motion of MBS, in a symbolic manner, i.e. exactly as if you were writing them by hand, whatever the size and the morphological complexity of the application. Hence, this course will instead teach you how to intervene upstream and downstream this generation step.\nUpstream the latter, you will learn how to translate a real system, e.g. a car suspension, into a virtual multibody model comprising bodies, joints, internal or external forces and torques and imposed motion\u2026 with a level of refinement that will be dictated by the original issue. For example, what is the minimum tire ground force when the car suspension is excited by a shaker?\nDownstream the symbolic generation, your intervention will consist in:\n\nCompleting the symbolic model with features that are specific to your system, e.g. a tire force model or the tuning of a motion controller, among other things;\nImplementing under the form of a program (in Python, Matlab, or C) a time simulation to solve the differential equations of motion, given the original question: e.g. find the transient motion of the system submitted to forces and torques and compute a specific force time history or the maximal acceleration of a particular point.\nSelecting the most suitable results, including self-explanatory - and sometimes funny - video animations of your multibody system in motion.\n\nIn sum, this course, based on the use of the ROBOTRAN* symbolic generator, will allow you to focus on the most interesting aspects of the multibody modeling process, by entirely mastering your computer model from the input data to the results, instead of using a black-box multibody software that clearly goes against the educational objective of this course. \nEnjoy Multibody Dynamics! \n*Note: The course was built to teach modeling and simulation of multibody systems, and not to teach any specific software.

    "course_description": "This Data Structures & Algorithms course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.\nYou will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim\u2019s and Kruskal\u2019s.\nPrim\u2019s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal\u2019s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest.\nThe other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an \u201cout of the box\u201d approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a \u201crolling hash\u201d to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.",

    "course_description": "The focus of this class is on the language of first-order logic , a formally defined language that allows us to make precise and unambiguous statements about any subject of interest.\nUsing the language of first-order logic we will investigate many foundational topics in logic. We will address such questions as what counts as a grammatical expression, and the circumstances under which it makes a claim about the world (whether it can be considered true or false, E.g. \u201cthe sky is brown\u201d, as compared to \u201coh, my goodness!\u201d).\nFor expressions that do make claims \u2014 we call these sentences \u2014 we can further examine whether they are true or false in particular situations. \u201cAristotle is alive\u201d is a sentence that was once true, but became false around 2000 years ago, and has remained false ever since.\nThese questions fall into the study of semantics , or meaning.\nOnce we understand how sentences can be considered true or false, we can investigate important related questions. Some sentences are always true, that is true in every situation \u2014 we call such sentences logical truths. Sentences bear relationships with one another. For example, two sentences might be true in exactly the same situations - they are logically equivalent. We will demonstrate methods for determining when these properties and relationships hold as natural extensions to the semantic theory for first-order logic.\nFinally, we will explore the limits of first-order logic. There are some sentences of English that are not expressible in the language, and it is important to know that this is the case, and to understand why it is so. This observation has led logicians to develop yet more powerful languages with more complex semantics. Almost all of these languages are based on the language of first-order logic and knowledge of first-order logic is fundamental to understanding them. So first-order logic is a basic building block for the study of these language and is a great place to begin the journey into the field of logic.",

As soon as you are dealing with real-life data, you will need to get an idea of what these data tell you and how you can visualize this (descriptive statistics). But you will also want to perform some analysis (inferential statistics): you may want to build a model that mimics reality, estimate some quantities, or test some hypotheses.\nThe statistics course in this series will help you refresh your knowledge on these topics. Along the way you will learn how to apply these concepts to datasets, using the statistical software R.\nThis course offers enough depth to cover the statistics you need to succeed in your engineering master\u2019s or profession in areas such as machine learning, data science and more.\nThis is a review course\nThis self-contained course is modular, so you do not need to follow the entire course if you wish to focus on a particular aspect. As a review course you are expected to have previously studied or be familiar with most of the material.

The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth.\nGoal 1, \u201cEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere,\u201d calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10, \u201cReduce inequality within and among countries,\u201d calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world.\nThis course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict. Finally, the course will conclude with a look at policy approaches and tools for addressing poverty and inequality in a variety of contexts.\nUnderstanding Poverty and Inequality was created by the SDG Academy in partnership with the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution.\nThis course is for:\n\nPolicy professionals who want to understand the scale and scope of poverty and inequality in order to design effective interventions\nDevelopment practitioners seeking knowledge on poverty alleviation\nAdvanced undergraduates and graduate students interested in economics, development, and other key concepts related to the poverty and inequality",

    "course_description": "Persuasion is the central to leading leaders. As a program manager or project manager, you may lead a team with many senior contributors. Often they will have more experience, more skin in the game, and more reputation at stake. As a program manager, this task is even greater because your time is limited and your span of control across projects even greater. Being a compelling communicator takes more than what you learned for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam or Project Management Professional (PMP) exam. It takes program or project management experience and this certificate program.\nProgram managers must persuade quickly, and with great lasting impact. Program and project managers must persuade and manage their leadership presence for program or project success. Even if you are a traditional program or project manager or manage agile programs or projects, persuasive communication is vital to your success. Communicating more persuasively will lead to more effective risk management.\nThere are complete blindsports in the Project Management Institute, Inc's (PMI)\"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge\" (PMBOK Guide). Applying those processes and skills are just the basics of efficient communication.\nThat\u2019s why certified project managers will earn 10 professional development units (PDU) in this program. You will learn the balance needed to communicate effectively. \nAristotle first wrote about balancing logic, emotion, and presence over 2,000 years ago. Creating a balance between ethos, pathos, and logos, the persuader creates a message that grabs the attention of the audience and engages them as people. A person doesn\u2019t understand when they are not paying attention, is not engaged with the speaker, and doesn\u2019t remember what was said. Ethos, pathos, and logos aid the speaker and the listener, by helping to select information to present and how to fashion its delivery for the best effect.\nIn this program management and project management training course, you will go beyond the communication skills you learned for the PMP exam to gain your project management certification. You will learn about the rhetorical triangle and how to use it to craft persuasive communications. Social media and online collaboration tools require new ways of establishing your presence and generating trust between you and your audience. You will also learn how to create an emotional impact even through text messages and emails.",

The practice of UX design uses the user-centered approach and covers 3 main activities: UX research (getting to know the users and their contexts), activities surrounding ideation (such as \"design thinking\" and participatory design) and prototyping. This course teaches methods, techniques and digital tools specific to UX in today's business context.\nA UX professional is able to intervene in the design process of a digital product or service in order to ensure a user-centered approach. This allows the organization to respond to the expectations of its users. A UX professional mobilizes a range of interview and observation methodologies until the development of a prototyped interface.\nUXPA defines user experience professionals as specialists involved in research, design and evaluation of products and services. Conceptually, this notion of user experience emerges from the human-centered design approach in the field of human machine interaction and human factors in industrial engineering.\nResearch corresponds to the activity of learning about user interfaces and the context in which they will be used.\nEvaluation corresponds to user observation when using these interfaces, as much before, during and after the design and development of the product.\nDesign corresponds to the standards and principles of design of digital products or services offering optimal user experiences.\nOverall objective of the MOOC:\nDiscuss what the user experience is in the context of business practice",

    "course_description": "Can you think of an area of your life that is influenced by statistics? Many times when we think about statistics in our daily lives, we think about numerical expressions of statistics, such as the number of daily COVID cases in our county, the percentage of students admitted each year to our university, or the number of people that voted in the last election. From each of these examples, we could go on to make inferences or look to answer questions based on this data, such as whether to open restaurants, how many new students are psychology majors, or if a specific issue drove voters to the polls in a specific state.\nThis course will begin by introducing the basic concepts of how to describe and visualize data, the fundamentals of using statistics to make inferences, and the logic of null hypothesis testing. Various types of hypothesis tests will be introduced, along with criteria for selecting which is appropriate for different study conditions. As an extension of null hypothesis significance tests, you will learn about how to interpret effect sizes and confidence intervals, along with statistical power, before being introduced to alternatives to null hypothesis significance testing. All this is fleshed out in Data Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences.",

Artful Thinking research discovered that six thinking dispositions can be strengthened by engaging with art. The first course covers three of these dispositions\u2014 Observing and Describing , Reasoning with Evidence , and Questioning and Investigating. This second course will explores the other three\u2014 Comparing and Connecting , Exploring Viewpoints , and Finding Complexity.\n\nStarting with the disposition Comparing and Connecting , you'll learn strategies for making comparisons between different works of art and making connections to oneself, curriculum content, and larger issues in society.\nNext, you'll focus on the disposition of Exploring Viewpoints , learning tools for stepping inside the perspectives of figures in a work of art, and how to do so with self-awareness, respect, and empathy.\nFinally, you\u2019ll learn techniques to help your students hone the disposition of Finding Complexity by going beyond the surface of a work of art to consider its parts, purposes, and complexities.\n\nYou'll see Live-Action Lesson Videos showing real teachers with students of various grade levels, in math, science, social studies, language arts, and visual arts, discussing art in classrooms and at the museum and demonstrating a thinking routine\u2014a strategy consisting of open-ended questions centered around a thinking disposition.\nYou'll explore artworks for yourself using thinking routines and zoomable tools. Featured artworks grapple with complex ideas \u2014from mathematical thinking to botany, from family dynamics to forgiveness, and from globalization to indigenous histories. No matter what subject or level you teach, you\u2019ll find lessons and resources that relate to your practice.\nIn our In-Dialogue Videos , you\u2019ll hear from two Harvard researchers talking with our museum educators. In their conversations, they examine the benefits and challenges of teaching through art different facets of complex thinking.\nYou\u2019ll be part of a global learning community in which you can document, share, and reflect on your experience integrating art and developing complex thinking with your students.",

    "institution": "The University of California, San Diego",
    "course_description": "Everyone has an opinion on parenting \u2013 where babies should sleep, what they should eat, and whether parents should spank, scold, or praise. What\u2019s more, the media often offers support for whichever opinions appear most popular at any given time. This leavesthose of us who like to base our decisions on firm, provablefacts feeling dizzy.  \n\u201cThe Science of Parenting\u201d addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by looking directly at the science. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents \u2013 or future parents \u2013 make sensible, informed decisions.   \nOne goal of this coursewill be to provide a survey of important scientific findings spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents:  \n\ndiet\nsleep\ndiscipline\nlearning\nscreen time\nimpulse control\nvaccination\n\nWe\u2019ll also explore ongoing mysteries , like what causes autism, and why so many children are allergic to peanuts.  \nPerhaps more important, this coursewill not only dig into existing science, but will also explore the underlying nature of parenting science itself. Often, scientists measure correlations: They ask how different parenting practices are related to different behaviors in children. But the claims they make from 'correlational data are often much, much stronger. For example, from correlational data, scientists often claim that parents cause the behaviors of their kids. This coursewill show how this type of error \u2013 common in the scientific literature \u2013 can explain a significant amount of the confusion present in the media and general public. Wewill discuss how to avoid the same error when evaluating science, and how to use the sum of available evidence to inform decision making.  \nThe course\u2019s instructor, David Barner, is a leading authority on cognitive development. He is joined by leading experts on behavior genetics, vaccination, autism, lying, and spanking, as well as by real live parents who try to use science to inform their decisions. This class is suitable not only for parents, future parents, and grandparents, but also for professionals interested in health care, social work, and early childhood education who want to increase their knowledge and analysis skills.",

    "course_description": "In our daily lives, many of us ask questions of ourselves and about others. Some of these questions, born of simple curiosity, resemble elements of qualitative research. For instance, what will I wear today\u2014and what motives, both overt and hidden to the world, will guide those choices? Or, why does my neighbor seem particularly downtrodden today when he\u2019s normally happy? Or, for what reasons is my favorite charitable organization having difficulty recruiting new members this year, especially when the factors surrounding recruitment haven\u2019t changed? These, and other questions, may arise from our observations and our experiences of the world in which we live. As you will learn in this course, these questions become qualitative research projects when the right methods and analytical processes are learned and applied.\nThrough qualitative research, we are able to explore\u2014through methods like interviews and observations\u2014various facets of individuals\u2019 lived experiences. Qualitative research in psychology arises from historical and cross-disciplinary foundations, as well as from dynamic philosophical underpinnings. We will focus on the past and present of qualitative inquiry, with grounding in contemporary examples across a variety of psychology fields. Through tools, illustrations, and self-assessments, you will learn some of the basics of qualitative research while examining your own research predilections and experiences. We hope you will emerge with an understanding of, and appreciation for, how qualitative inquiry adds depth, character, and nuance to our understanding of humans\u2019 individual and collective experiences.\nQualitative research usually involves naturalistic inquiry. This means that we explore human experiences of the real world as they\u2019re living it, or as it was lived. Qualitative inquiry invites inquiry into everyday living experiences. Through an array of qualitative traditions and their associated methods, we can investigate beliefs, biases, behaviors, routines, roles, cultures, and other facets of the human experience. Here, you will learn about the foundations of qualitative inquiry\u2014and how it differs from quantitative research, yet in complementary ways. Relatedly, you will gain practice in common qualitative traditions\u2014like phenomenology and ethnography\u2014and some of the methods they use, such as interviewing. We hope you will gain the competence, confidence, and \u201cknow-how\u201d to begin planning your own qualitative study of a topic in psychology.",

    "course_description": "This Data Structures & Algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.\nYou will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. Both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are O(log n). AVL trees are a subgroup of BSTs and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from BSTs. Additionally, AVLs incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance. (2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues.\nAs you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide & Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.\nThe course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.",

However, the design of blockchain involves cryptographic technology, which cannot be easily understood by those who are not professionals in the area of IT and security. \nIn order to better understand what kinds of applications best fit blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology and the potentials of these emerging technologies, it is important to understand the design rationale, the basic technology, the underlying cryptographic fundamentals, and its limitations. This 6-week online coursewill walk you through the following: \n\nThe design rationale behind blockchain and the issues for such decentralized ledger (transaction) systems.\nThe underlying technology (e.g. how the fundamental algorithms - the cryptographic primitives - work together) behind and how it makes blockchain works and safe.\nThe differences of the various existing blockchain platforms and what these platforms can provide (e.g. pros and cons of the major platforms).\nWhat kinds of applications (both traditional and emerging) best fit the blockchain technology and how blockchain technology can benefit these applications.\nBlockchain does have its limitations. We will uncover the problems and the limitations of blockchain technology to enable developers and researchers to think about how to enhance the existing blockchain technology and practitioners to better address the issues when using blockchains in their applications.\nThis course will also briefly discuss the downside of blockchain with respect to the protection of criminal activities (e.g. why ransomware always ask for bitcoins as ransom, and the money laundering problem).\n\nThe course aims at targeting a wide audience: This course will provide learners a good understanding of the technological, applicability, limitations and \"illegal\" usage of the blockchain technology.",

Geared towards software developers, DevOps professionals, software engineers, web application developers, and others interested in learning how to develop secure software, this course focuses on practical steps that can be taken, even with limited resources, to improve information security. This course will enable software developers to create and maintain systems that are much harder to successfully attack, reduce the damage when attacks are successful, and speed the response so that any latent vulnerabilities can be rapidly repaired.\nThis course discusses the basics of security, such as what risk management really means. It discusses how to consider security as part of the requirements of a system, and what potential security requirements you might consider. This part then discusses how to design software to be secure, including various secure design principles that will help you avoid bad designs and embrace good ones. It also discusses how to secure your software supply chain, that is, how to more securely select and acquire reused software (including open source software) to enhance security.\nThis is the first of the three courses in the Secure Software Development Fundamentals Professional Certificate program, and was developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a project of the Linux Foundation focused on securing the open source ecosystem.

The course is divided into 6 sections. While we encourage students to follow the structure of the course, each section can be used/studied independently as part of a course or research focus.\nTopics covered: Critical thinking: tools, narratives, and critiques * Sex work * Drug use and supply * Investigative journalism * Wildlife and animal trafficking * Human trafficking * Selling sex in cyber space * Online sleuths and scam baiters\nKey questions explored: What is critical thinking? What is crime? What is media? How does the media influence our understanding of crime? How does the media help and hinder our perceptions about crime? How does the digital age shape our understanding of crime? How does media shape our perceptions and fears of the control of crime? Is social justice helped and/or hindered by social media?\nSpeakers: This course is developed by the University of Hong Kong, but we have experts joining us from around the world.

Your body is an amazing machine that is equipped with the capacity to deal with the world's great stressors.\nThis course may be different from other courses you have taken online. Our intention is to create more than just a class conveying information; we want to create an educational experience. You will be engaged in stories about physiology from across the country, develop relationships with the instructors as they sacrifice their bodies for the good of science and be awed by the complexity and adaptability of the human body. You will also have the opportunity to hear from top scientists and adventurers in the field. The class will illustrate and explain how your body responds to cold, heat, stress, age, altitude, g-forces, diving and zero gravity. Video travel and interview locations include Stanford, Harvard, MIT, US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Pikes Peak, Mt Kilimanjaro, Las Vegas, and the skies above Livermore, California.\nThe Story\nCorey stumbled into Dr. Friedlander's Exercise Physiology class early in his college career. Eventually becoming her teaching assistant, the two joined forces to discover new and exciting ways to teach physiology to Stanford students. Together they decided that the best way for Corey to really understand the material was to experience a series of diverse physiologic stressors first hand. What resulted was a series of wild and crazy adventures captured on video that provide a novel approach to teaching you the fundamentals of environmental physiology. From cold tanks to aging suits to flying fighter planes and climbing mountains, Corey and Anne bring the science to life. Come join us and be a part of our story as we learn about the human body!\nAbout the team\nThe teaching team is composed of professors, students, storytellers and video producers. We interface with academic researchers and real life people in order to create an experience that draws life-long learners closer to science. We make fun, experiential videos on each topic that lead the participants into other supporting online learning materials that explain the underlying physiology. Support for this project came from the Stanford Vice Provost for Online Learning (VPOL), the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, and the Program in Human Biology.",

How can we write dialogue that sings with sub-text, and embodies your own distinctive creative voice? We will look closely at form, and find ways of relating theme to style. How should we structure a play-text so that it is active and makes every dramatic beat count? How will you use stage direction, music and set design to develop the metaphoric world of your play? All these questions and more will be answered.\nWe will be thinking comparatively about advice from the most famous script-editors and dramaturgs, as well as investigating the work of Brecht, Richard Schechner, Augusto Boal, Japanese Noh theatre, and epic forms of theatre from around the world. We will explore how theory may inspire creative practice and vice versa. What commonalities does theatre-making share in cultural communities across the world and why is important that we reference creative practices outside our own? Join us and expand your perspective on what is possible with space, words, and live performance.\nLearning to pace a story effectively, to engage and surprise an audience(and to make them laugh!), are useful skills for your professional development outside the Arts.\nSkill transferability, flexible thinking, and expert language abilities are now essential in a diversifying global job market - come and learn essential new skills, and have fun doing it!\nYou will be set writing exercises over the course of the module, and you will asked to keep a brief creativity journal to note how your ideas progress and how your intuition leads you into productivity. By the end of this module, you will have completed a plan for the structure of a new play. You will have tried out different ways of writing dialogue and found one that suits you \u2013 you will be invited to share this in a discussion forum with your peers.",

If you know the causes of these events and conditions, they can all be prevented.\nIn this course, you will learn how to use the TU Delft mind-set to investigate the causes of such events so you can prevent them in the future.\nWhen, for instance, hundreds of hospital patients worldwide got infected after having gall bladder treatments, forensic engineering helped reveal how the design and use of the medical instruments could cause such widespread infections. As a result, changes were made to the instrument design and the procedural protocols in hospitals. Learning from failure in this case benefitted patient health and safety across the world.\nAfter taking this course you will have an understanding of failures and the investigation processes used to find their causes. You will learn how to apply lessons gained from investigating previous failures into new designs and procedures.\nThe TU Delft Forensic Engineering mind-set involves recommendations for:\n\nData collection ranging from desk studies (theoretical/predicted performance of structures) to field investigations (actual performance of failed structures)\nHypothesis generation techniques for technical and procedural causes of failure\nHypothesis testing for engineering aspects of forensic cases\nReporting findings about the most likely causes and consequences\nImproving engineering designs based on lessons learned from forensic cases\n\nThe course uses case studies from Building Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Biomechanical Engineering. All of these provide great examples that illustrate the approaches and highlight technical and procedural causes of failure. You'll find that not only is it crucial, but it's also exciting to learn from failures.\nThis course is most useful for:\n\nStudents who want to familiarize themselves with forensic engineering\nBuilding, aeronautical, biomechanical designers and engineers\nForensic investigators, police, legal and insurance professionals\nProfessionals from municipalities, government agencies or clients who are asked to perform internal forensic investigations\n\nThis course has been designed by TU Delft's international experts on safety issues, failure investigations and forensics.

This course answers all these questions and many more!\nThis course explores the tenets of game design, core game structure, the components of a game, and the different areas of specialization within game design. We look at theoretical design frameworks as conceptual models for approaching design and the fundamental concepts in game psychology, motivation and game experience. The course describes the models that explain the various player types and play styles (what types of people play games, and what motivates and interests them).\nFinally, you will learn about core game mechanics and challenge dynamics, and how your designs can be improved by thinking about them from a psychological, player-centric perspective.\nThroughout this course, we use classic video game examples such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Solitaire to see what they can teach us about games and game design.\n\n\n\n\n\n*",

    "course_description": "Context \nWhile health is one of several factors influencing diets, it is a powerful one, especially in certain life situations such as illness and the birth of a child. \nDoctors enjoy special authority when speaking on matters of health and could play a key role in informing and persuading people to change their eating habits \u2013 during consultations but also through other channels. The global obesity epidemic, the rise of personalized medicine and increased understanding of the microbiome are also likely to converge into a situation where doctors can prescribe food as medicine, giving them influence over the decision, implementation, and confirmation stages as well. \nCurrently, a key obstacle to medical professionals playing a stronger role in food systems transformation is their relative lack of training in nutrition, let alone sustainability. On the other hand, linking personal health to the health of the planet will for some people be an increased motivator to rethink diets. If medical doctors had better knowledge of the link between food, health, nutrition, and sustainability, they could play an active role in transforming our food system. \nSolution \nTo overcome this gap in knowledge and to reinforce behaviour change towards healthier and sustainable diets, EIT Food has developed a short online course on nutrition targeting medical students. In addition, professionals in the medical sector may find this course useful for providing an up-to-date analysis of topical nutrition debates.\nThe course title is \u201c Nutrition for Health and Sustainability \u201d. It is composed of 12 hours of learning broken down in 3 modules.\nOn this course, students will look at what makes up a healthy diet and see what types of foods play a crucial part in preventing diseases. Learners will have the opportunity to build an understanding of the relationship between food and disease and get accustomed to nutrition counselling techniques. They\u2019ll also reflect on the possible biological, social, and psychological causes of unhealthy eating patterns, and interpret the importance of evidence-based nutrition both for human and planet health.\nAmbition \nOur mission is to empower the future and current generation of medical doctor. We\u2019ll equip them with fundamentals nutrition knowledge and nutrition counselling skills so that they could become the agents of change our society need.\nThe goal to establish nutrition as a key part of healthcare.\nHigh level contributors \nThis course has been designed with and for medical students (undergrad or higher).

Would you like to stay abreast of the latest trends and strategies in project finance and be able to use these to your advantage?\nThis course will provide you with the fundamental knowledge and necessary tools to create the ideal financing structure for your project and enhance its potential for attracting funding.\nYou will also gain essential insights into the mindset of project investors and lenders, which is particularly useful to those who work on infrastructure or industrial projects and need to have a good understanding of how project financing works as well as how risk assessments are carried out.\nKeeping up to date with trends in project financing is also important. For instance, since projects are increasingly set up through cooperation between different groups of stakeholders, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), this ultimately leads to a range of novel contracts and financing methods.\nOur hands-on approach\nRooted in both theoretical rigor and practical applicability, our approach uses case studies to illustrate key concepts and provides real-world assignments so you will gain first-hand experience in what it takes to put together a financeable project. \nAt the end of the course, you will know what is required to achieve successful project financing and will have created a financial model for your own project.\nNew cases and activities\nThe demands of project management in engineering are continually evolving. In response to this, several enhancements have been made to this course, and new examples are presented not only to enhance your project management skills but also to help you secure essential funding.\nOur project management courses\nThis course is part of our Engineering Project Management series. It is an ideal course for learners who want to build on the basic knowledge gained in the course Project Management of Engineering Projects: Preparing for Success and be able to deal with the financing aspects in considerably more detail.

    "course_description": "At the beginning of this course we introduce the determinant, which yields two important concepts that you will use in this course. First, you will be able to apply an invertibility criterion for a square matrix that plays a pivotal role in, for example, the understanding of eigenvalues. You will also use the determinant to measure the amount by which a linear transformation changes the area of a region. This idea plays a critical role in computer graphics and in other more advanced courses, such as multivariable calculus. \nThis course then moves on to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The goal of this part of the course is to decompose the action of a linear transformation that may be visualized. The main applications described here are to discrete dynamical systems, including Markov chains. However, the basic concepts\u2014 eigenvectors and eigenvalues\u2014are useful throughout industry, science, engineering and mathematics. \nProspective students enrolling in this class are encouraged to first complete the linear equations and matrix algebra courses before starting this class.",

    "course_description": "Climate change, biodiversity loss and pan-syndemics are some of today\u2019s most pressing complex challenges. Much of our economies and societies are exhaustive, vulnerable, and unfair. We need to actively restore and regenerate ecosystems and their services while transforming our economies to become more circular and just. We require new knowledge systems and cultures leading to transformative action as the human impact on earth needs to be fundamentally redesigned.\n\n\nScientific knowledge and reasoning are the fundamental tools to guide policy and management decisions, especially in times of crises. But the limitations of reductionist science are evident due to the lack of widespread action in addressing today's highly complex challenges, which are self-emergent, unpredictable, span across nested scales, depend on societal behavioral transitions, and lack data.\n\n\nDesign disciplines offer creative ways of prototyping solutions in an iterative way. Design responds to a current problem by proposing future pathways, through a feedback exchange from praxis. Designerly praxis can benefit from science, for example by directing interventions and leveraging relationships based on quantitative data. Neither the analytical and descriptive tools of science, nor the iterative process of design alone are adequate for addressing complex challenges. Combining both cultures and methods of reasoning as a fluid, intervention-based and synergistic process is beneficial for fostering the regenerative, transformative action that is urgently required.\n\n\nTherefore, this MOOC series entitled \u201cDesigning Resilient Regenerative Systems\u201d (DRRS) offers four consecutive MOOCs that aim to address these urgent and complex challenges. Participants are invited on a learning journey that includes emphasis on extending our worldviews, concepts like regeneration and resilience, befriending complexity and uncertainty, methods and hybrid practices of science and design, meta-design and the seeing of patterns and root causes, connecting more with our inner self, and becoming bio-regional weavers within communities of transformational learning and praxis.\n\n\nThis first MOOC places global crises in context with local and regional examples for planetary health. Participants build consciousness by questioning the dominant reductionist worldviews that drive our global societies and learn ways of rethinking our relationship with nature as a holistic approach of \u201cinterbeing,\u201d which places humans as part of the broader web of life.",

Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as \"back ends\" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses.

For some scholars the 21st century globe will see the most significant change of human history - the move of most of the world to live in cities - a planetary urbanism that has changed the way we live globally, the way we organise ourselves economically and the impact humanity has on our environment in an age that we consequently now describe as the Anthropocene.\nMost of the urban growth on the planet will be in the global South and this is where we concentrate the attention of this course, drawing on the work of a five-year programme known as PEAK Urban, involving a collaboration of researchers from China, Colombia, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nThrough the partnership of five renowned academic institutions around the world - the University of Oxford, Peking University (Beijing), The African Centre for Cities (Cape Town), Indian Institute for Human Settlements (Bengaluru) and EAFIT University (Medell\u00edn), the PEAK Urban programme aims to aid decision-making on urban futures by:\n\nGenerating new research grounded in the logic of urban complexity;\nFostering the next generation of leaders that draw on different perspectives and backgrounds to address the greatest urban challenges of the 21st century; and,\nGrowing the capacity of cities to understand and plan their own future.\n\nShaping Urban Futures aims to demonstrate how complementary research projects have applied the PEAK Urban framework \u2013 Prediction, Emergence, Adoption and Knowledge \u2013 to uncover interrelated issues of health, climate change, migration and informality in places that will face the biggest challenges from rapid unplanned urbanisation.\nThis course consists of 6 modules, with an Introduction and a Closing module sandwiching 4 core modules. Each module involves around 5-6 hours of learning. To get the best out of the course, learners are encouraged to view all the video lectures and conversations, go through other learning material, work on all the assignments and assessments, and participate in discussions in a constructive and respectful manner.\nThis course is designed principally for people working in cities who want to make a difference and for all urban scholars, from early career researchers to veteran urbanists and everyone in between. This course will also hopefully inspire workers in local government, community organisations and the private sector as well as urban scholars to build upon the experiences of a global network to develop their own methods and frames to view, interpret and define urban changes in their local geographies and contexts.",

    "course_description": "It has become almost impossible to imagine what our lives would be like without the many benefits of packaging - just think about the different packaging and single-use items you use on a daily basis. Yet as our global population grows in size and affluence, both our collective demand for packaging materials and the waste we generate as a result will increase dramatically.\nCurrently, large amounts of packaging waste escape formal collection and recycling systems and eventually end up polluting the environment. Moreover, their material value is forever lost to the economy. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that uncollected plastic packaging waste alone is worth somewhere between 80 to 120 billion dollars a year.\nSo how can we improve packaging systems in order to capture this wasted potential? Clearly, the way we currently design, recover, and reuse packaging urgently needs a rethink!\nIn this course, you will learn about the design of sustainable packaging systems. To do so we will explore the design and business strategies of the circular economy.\nContrary to our current industrial model, which extracts, uses and ultimately disposes of resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design. This means that products and services are reimagined from a systems perspective in order to minimize waste, maximize positive economic, environmental and social impacts, and keep resources locked in a cycle of restoration.\nThis course is for you if you are interested in learning about sustainable packaging design. You'll also benefit if you are a professional in the packaging industry and want to learn how to find circular opportunities in your work. Students - particularly in design -will be able to broaden their knowledge of circular design and business strategies.",

From online video meetings to internet services, from social media platforms to online games, we all use and interact with distributed systems on a daily basis and increasingly depend on them. Designing and operating such large-scale distributed systems, however, is complex and typically involves making reasonable compromises. There are fundamental technical barriers as well as economic arguments why we cannot make these systems behave as if they were running on a single, perfectly reliable machine.. \nIn this course, learners will be introduced to the essential functional and non-functional concerns of distributed systems and the common problems encountered while designing them, such as consistency, availability, elasticity, and scalability. A variety of practical solutions that have been established in the leading tech industry in recent years will be reviewed. These provide re-usable building blocks to create new large-scale applications. These recent developments, especially around cloud computing, large-scale data processing, distributed machine learning, and other fields are often not reflected in textbooks and are absent from many traditional curricula but are at the heart of this course. \nThe course will therefore provide learners with the fundamental understanding (theoretical and practical foundations) of how cloud, edge, and big data processing systems work and how they address common challenges for distributed systems such as performance, resilience, and scalability.\nThe learning progress is assessed through a variety of different activities including quizzes, design exercises, experiments, and open questions, with peer review of other students\u2019 solutions.

This trend is particularly significant in sectors that address social issues such as health, social, educational and judicial interventions and services. This movement can be seen in the emergence of new approaches that promote an increased use of research: knowledge translation, evidence-informed decision-making and practices, knowledge mobilization, knowledge utilization, knowledge enhancement, etc.\nStudies on the subject show that the process leading to the use of knowledge is so complex that science and research still barely get taken into account in practice and decision-making communities. There is consensus in scientific literature that the efforts made to make scientific knowledge available are necessary, but not sufficient, for their actual use in practice communities.

Will societies and peoples find a way to get along together despite intractable conflicts and divergence of social and national interests? Will States delegate enough sovereignty to universal organizations, rather than keeping power within national borders? Will the world ever be governed, and more democratically governed? This course in global politics aims to explore these key questions. It draws on a mix of disciplines - anthropology, history, sociology, economics and psychology - and a mix of paradigms, as no one approach is sufficient to explain the complexity of global issues today.

Because wind and solar power output is weather-dependent, it is variable in nature and somewhat more uncertain than output from conventional fossil fuel generators. It is therefore important to consider how to manage high penetrations of solar and wind so as to maintain electricity system reliability. \nThis introductory course, delivered by Ieading academics from Imperial College London, with technical input and contributions from the National Energy Renewable Lab (Golden, Colorado), will discuss what challenges variable output renewables pose to the achievability of a reliable, stable electricity system, how these challenges can be addressed and at what costs. Its overall objective is to demonstrate that there is already a range of established technologies, policies and operating procedures to achieve a flexible, stable, reliable electricity system with a high penetration of renewables such as wind and solar. \nThe course uses a variety of country and context-specific examples to demonstrate the concepts. Policy makers, regulators, grid operators and investors in renewable electricity will benefit from a solid understanding of these considerations, thereby helping them drive forward the development of a fit-for-purpose clean power system in their own regional context.",

    "course_description": "Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.\nAccording to the Basel Accords, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today\u2019s world.\nThis course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.",

Global climate change causes temperatures to rise and precipitation patterns to change. A growing degree of urbanization causes people to move from the countryside to the cities. This results in increased competition over water resources, like rivers and groundwater, between cities and their surrounding areas. Furthermore, population growth and rising global welfare create an increased demand for food.\nThe growing demand for food must be obtained using existing agricultural land, since we are already dealing with scarcity of new farmland. Yet, the potential of increased production in the existing rain-fed agricultural areas is low.\nSustainable water management; various perspectives to consider\nThe combination of the processes described above create an urgent need for improved agricultural water management, agriculture being the dominant water user worldwide. In our search for sustainable solutions the management and governance regarding irrigation and drainage should take a number of water related aspects into account, among which:\n\u2022 the different perspectives of involved uses and users\n\u2022 including various spatial levels, from farm, to scheme, to river basin\n\u2022 minding the effects on both upstream and downstream water users\n\u2022 each of which must be combined with the right quantity and quality of water\nWageningen University & Research is actively involved in debates on water and food. Predominantly focussing on the combination of both water technologies and social factors, this creates a unique socio-technical approach.\nPutting theory into practice\nIn this MOOC, we will focus on the role agricultural water management plays in this global context of sustainable water and food supplies. The online course consists of several learning modules, combined with a case study.\nWe start by taking a deep dive into practical and technical aspects, from crop characteristics and irrigation water requirements to actual field practices.\nSubsequently, we explore the institutional perspective, from models of rural development to water management demands.\nThe case study videos and interviews from Morocco create the opportunity for you to directly apply your newly acquired knowledge in a real-life situation.\nFor whom?\nThis MOOC is for anyone with basic knowledge of social and biophysical sciences, ready to contribute to improving agricultural water management from where they are. Are you ready?

Much of our economies are exhaustive, vulnerable, and unfair. We must actively restore and regenerate ecosystems while transforming our economies to become more circular and just. We require new knowledge systems and cultures leading to transformative action as the human impact on earth needs to be fundamentally redesigned.\nScientific knowledge and reasoning are fundamental tools to guide policy decisions, especially in times of crises. Limitations of reductionist science are evident due to the lack of widespread action in addressing today's highly complex challenges, which are self-emergent, unpredictable, span across nested scales, depend on societal behavioral transitions, and lack data.\nDesign offers creative ways of intervening iteratively, responding to a current problem by prototyping future pathways. Designerly praxis benefits from science, for example, by directing interventions and leveraging relationships based on quantitative data. Neither science's analytical and descriptive tools nor the iterative design process alone are adequate for addressing complex challenges. Combining both cultures and methods of reasoning as a fluid, intervention-based, and synergistic process is beneficial for fostering the urgently required regenerative, transformative action.\nThis MOOC series, \"Designing Resilient Regenerative Systems\u201d offers four consecutive MOOCs that address these urgent and complex challenges. Participants emerge on a learning journey including an emphasis on holistic worldviews, concepts like regeneration and resilience, befriending complexity and uncertainty, methods and hybrid practices of science and design, connecting more with our inner self, and becoming bio-regional weavers within communities of learning and praxis.\nThis second MOOC focuses on scientific and designerly ways of dealing with complexity. By developing a critical perspective on systems thinking, participants embody their practice of navigating in complexity by continuously zooming out and in as a view from above. A functional understanding of transformative resilience is complemented with an introduction to social network analysis. We learn about circularities and how to design for circularity, leading us to the final theme of how to innovate in complex systems - systemic innovation.",

International EMC experts David Pommerenke and Bernd Deutschmann break down situations that seem highly complex in order to highlight the causes of interference.\nThis course is designed to gain essential know-how in today\u2019s world of very high frequencies. For instance, smartphone CPUs already work with clock frequencies above 3 GHz. But did you know that such fast switching disturbs other devices nearby? Such disturbances are either simply annoying or can become a real problem. As a consequence, international regulations exist which demand for emission and immunity tests before selling an electronic device.\nThe topic of EMC must be considered in all aspects of circuit design in order to reduce the number of prototypes. We would like you to gain an intuition for EMC with the help of lab examples. We emphasize basic physical principles and avoid highly complex mathematical derivations instead. After completion, a certificate will be awarded. We are already working on three follow-up courses to obtain a professional EMC certificate, backed by Graz University of Technology.\nTU Graz offers more than 10 on-campus lectures on the subject of EMC, most of them in small laboratory groups. More than 10 full-time employees investigate electromagnetism in a variety of applications just in our research group only. We would like to share this expertise with the community, since EMC must be considered by all electronics engineers and project managers.\nThe FREE version of this course includes all material except final exam questions and the certificate.

    "course_description": "This course will teach you how to digitalize the 'conventional' grid and which digital technologies you can use for this, including but not limited to, AI, machine learning, blockchain and computer simulations.\nEven though the power grid has been the main driver of the rapid advancement of technology in the past decades, the engineering of the grid is outdated by today's standards. Equipment is still hardwired and analogue, there is limited data acquisition, and many control actions are performed manually. Subsequently, it becomes harder to ensure similar system quality and efficient operations when more renewables are added to the grid. The next big leap, therefore, is to revamp and digitalize the energy system. \nWe invited five prominent industry leaders to share industry perspectives, case studies and applications of digitalization in the fields of Grid Operations, Electric Power Systems, Power Distribution, Electrical Systems, Control Systems and Cybersecurity, but also in Consultancy and Software Development. Our guest speakers are: Philip Gladek (CEO of Spectral), Bas Kruimer (Business Director Digital Grid Operations at DNV), Martin Wevers (Grid Planner at TenneT), Evelyn Heylen (Head of research at Centrica) and Antoine Marot (Lead AI Scientist at RTE). \nYou will also get hands-on experience through solving an optimal scheduling problem, noting the differences between different numerical simulation methods and applying machine learning to predict system overloads.\nThis course is aimed at professionals in the energy industry who want to broaden their perspective and discover alternative approaches to energy integration in an intelligent way such as:\n- grid operators, electrical systems managers, control systems managers, power engineers\n- cybersecurity consultants, software developers, artificial intelligence managers/ scientists, energy consultants\n- project managers, planners, policy makers etc.\nAny other enthusiasts with the desire to learn more about current practices of the power grid, novel digital technologies and trends to deploy them can also enrol in this course.\n\"At DNV, our vision is to be a trusted voice to tackle global transformations. The energy transition is vital to decelerate climate change. Integrating energy systems in an intelligent way is a critical skill for the engineers, project managers, planners, policymakers, and scientists of the future.\nThe course \u201cDigitalization of intelligent and integrated energy systems\u201d comes at the right time to tackle the challenges and complexity of today\u2019s energy systems. It provides you with a powerful framework to digitalize energy systems by using AI, machine learning, simulations, digital twins and sheds light on cyber security matters.

In Alaska, around one million acres (4000 km2) burn every year, and record years have seen as many as six million acres burned. Most of these fires are allowed to spread naturally.\nHowever, when wildfires occur near population centers, they can be a serious threat to the safety and well-being of people. Recent disastrous fire seasons in Alaska, California, and Australia have shown how communities near forests, in what is known as the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), are increasingly at risk due to hotter and drier summer weather caused by climate change.\nIn the fight to protect these communities, remote sensing technology has become essential. Wildfire analysts use satellite imagery and powerful computer programs to predict fire risk, detect fires early, and monitor their spread. After a wildfire is extinguished, remote sensing is used to analyze the impact of a fire and to guide sustainable restoration efforts.\nParticipants in this course will learn about remote sensing of wildfires from instructors at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, located in one of the world\u2019s most active wildfire zones. Students will learn about wildfire behavior, and get hands-on experience with tools and resources used by professionals to create geospatial maps that support firefighters on the ground.\nUpon completion, students will be able to:\n\nAccess web resources that provide near real-time updates on active wildfires\nNavigate databases of remote sensing imagery and data\nAnalyze geospatial data to detect fire hot spots, map burn areas, and assess severity\nProcess image and GIS data in ArcGIS Pro\n\nVerified track learners will receive a one-year ArcGIS Pro license in addition to unlimited course access and a verified certificate.",

    "course_description": "Underestimating project complexity is widely accepted as one of the major causes of project failure. International studies reveal that a staggering 40% of projects fail to deliver on their promises\u00b9.\nAs with most external factors, many of the causes and consequences of complexity are difficult to avoid or control. Therefore, attempts to overcome these challenges by simply trying to reduce their causes is not enough.\nConventional project management practices often overlook the nuanced uncertainties inherent in engineering and infrastructure projects, usually linked to their length and scale. This is further exacerbated by the constantly changing technological and societal landscape.\nIn this course, you will learn our approach to mastering complexity, focused on front-end development and teamwork as catalysts for success. This will help you develop the skills you need to make timely actions to tackle complexities and improve your chances of project success.\nOur hands-on approach\nProject success starts with recognizing the main drivers of complexity, which can be highly subjective and highly dynamic. In this course, you will learn to identify what makes a project complex and how to perform a complexity assessment.\nExamining the elements of a project \u2013 such as interfaces, stakeholders, cultures, environment, technology, etc. \u2013 and their intricate interactions is key to mastering complexity.\nYou will analyze these elements in the context of your own project. Then, based on our complexity framework, you will identify the complexity footprint of your project and use it to adapt your management processes. With personalized guidance and feedback from our world-class instructors, you will learn how to recognize what competencies you need to develop project plans, how to adapt your management style accordingly, thus not only improving project performance but also enhancing your own decision-making capacity.\n\u201cBeing aware of complexity and embracing it might be the way forward,\u201d \u2013 Associate Professor Marian Bosch-Rekveldt\nNew cases and activities\nThe demands of project management in engineering are continually evolving. In response to this, several enhancements have been made to this course, and new examples are presented not only to enhance your project management skills but also to empower you so that you can thrive in complex project environments.\nOur project management courses\nThis course is part of our Engineering Project Management series. It is an ideal course for learners who want to build on the basic knowledge gained in the course Project Management of Engineering Projects: Preparing for Success and want to better navigate the complex challenges posed by engineering and other large projects. This series also offers a complementary course on Project Finance: Funding Projects Successfully.\n\u00b9 Merrow, 2010",

    "course_description": "Building adequate housing is a pressing issue worldwide. With close to a billion people currently living in slums, accommodating a growing population, and improving dwelling conditions is a critical issue for society.\nThis challenge cannot be solved with a one-size-fits-all approach. Every city, region and country demand their own housing models and prototypes. That\u2019s why housing design needs to negotiate many aspects simultaneously to achieve sustainable urban environments and inclusive dwelling communities.\nThis course uncovers how social, economic and environmental factors are interrelated in the design of housing settlements. For this, the course dives into three key aspects that anyone involved in housing design should take into consideration: time, environment, and community. Each of these aspects will be examined through a specific design approach, respectively:\n\nIncrementality : how dwelling environments should be able to accommodate growth and change through time.\nTypology Mix : how design can be responsive to different patterns of inhabitation, aspirations and cultural backgrounds, creating inclusive dwelling environments.\nClustering : what methods and strategies can shape the association of dwelling units in order to create meaningful communities.\n\nIn this course, each of these themes will be discussed in detail and exemplified by a new analytical approach to award-winning housing projects developed in different geopolitical contexts.\nWhile each of these themes will examine aspects related to the design decision-making process, the course aims at addressing concerns that go beyond the design disciplines. Hence, regardless of background or level of expertise, this course will introduce learners to the core issues and challenges of global housing design, using examples from different regions.\nThis course has been developed by TU Delft\u2019s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). It offers a unique combination of videos, documentation of key case studies, animations, and feedback sessions. We will discuss options for affordable housing design, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries.

Students will learn about the tradition of the \u201c100 views,\u201d and through these composite depictions of the city, will witness the excitement and loss of change. Kiyochika Kobayashi\u2019s woodblock prints of Tokyo in the late 1870s convey a moody view on the cusp of change as the new capital, formerly Edo, begins modernization with Western influences. Koizumi Kishio\u2019s depictions of the \u201cImperial Capital\u201d in the 1930s show the lively cosmopolitanism and move toward ultranationalism that placed the emperor at its center.\nLearners will navigate visual primary sources and use them to investigate:\n\u2022 Tokyo, through the many locations depicted at different points in time, especially helpful if they would like visit these sites today;\n\u2022 the Meiji restoration and how Tokyo emerged from the earlier city of Edo to become Japan\u2019s capital;\n\u2022 cultural and political interactions between east and west;\n\u2022 how Tokyo was rebuilt from various forms of destruction;\n\u2022 methods used by scholars and curators of the Visualizing Cultures project and Smithsonian Institution to develop online content and exhibitions;\n\u2022 the ability of visual motifs to capture tangible and intangible qualities of time and place;\n\u2022 how to read image sets, especially useful in the large digital archives of today;\n\u2022 woodblock print series, distribution, and competition from other media.\nThe format of roundtable discussions between art historian, historians, and media specialists sets up a discursive and exploratory style of learning. Learners will be exposed to multiple points of view as the teaching team brings together scholars who have studied the topics from different disciplines. Learners will engage with visual evidence as primary sources to assemble arguments.\nFor teachers, the course presents a number of units from the online resource, MIT Visualizing Cultures (VC). The course instructors are the authors of VC units, and guide students into the rich content on the site. The VC website, widely taught in both secondary and college courses, is the primary resource for this course. Educators can selectively pick modules that target needs in their classrooms; the course can be used in a \u201cflipped\u201d classroom where students are assigned modules as homework.\nOther Visualizing Cultures courses you may be interested in: Visualizing Japan (1850s-1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity (VJx)",

Before we can use these tools effectively, we need to know how to handle big data sets. You will understand how and why certain principles \u2013 such as immutability and pure functions \u2013 enable parallel data processing (\u2018divide and conquer\u2019), which is necessary to manage big data. \nDuring this course you will acquire this principal foundation from which to move forward. Namely, how to recognise and put into practice the scalable solution that\u2019s right for your situation. \nThe insights and tools of this course are regardless of programming language, but user-friendly examples are provided in Python, Hadoop HDFS and Apache Spark. Although these principles can also be applied to other sectors, we will use examples from the agri-food sector.\nData collection and processing in an Agri-food context\n Agri-food deserves special focus when it comes to choosing robust data management technologies due to its inherent variability and uncertainty. Wageningen University & Research\u2019s knowledge domain is healthy food and the living environment. That makes our data experts especially equipped to forge the bridge between the agri-food business on the one hand, and data science, artificial intelligence (AI) on the other. \nCombining data from the latest sensing technologies with machine learning/deep learning methodologies, allows us to unlock insights we didn\u2019t have access to before. In the areas of smart farming and precision agriculture this allows us to:\n\nBetter manage dairy cattle by combining animal-level data on behaviour, health and feed with milk production and composition from milking machines.\nReduce the amount of fertilisers (nitrogen), pesticides (chemicals) and water used on crops by monitoring individual plants with a robot or drone.\nMore accurately predict crop yields on a continental scale by combining current with historic data on soil, weather patterns and crop yields.\n\nIn short, this course\u2019s foundational knowledge and skills for big data prepare you for the next step: to find more effective and scalable solutions for smarter, innovative insights.\nFor whom?\nYou are a manager or researcher with a big data set on your hands, perhaps considering investing in big data tools. You\u2019ve done some programming before, but your skills are a bit rusty. You want to learn how to effectively and efficiently manage very large datasets. This course will enable you to see and evaluate opportunities for the application of big data technologies within your domain.

Microgrids are an important building block in designing this sustainable grid architecture of the future. This course covers fundamental concepts of microgrid design from a community-centric perspective and emphasizes a holistic approach to energy systems management.\nThis course:\n\nProvides knowledge and insights to critically evaluate microgrid systems design and related topics such as distributed renewable energy systems, energy storage demand response, and other load management techniques.\nPrioritizes a community-centric approach with a holistic approach to energy services, including not only electricity supply but also heating, cooling, and transportation applications.\nEmphasizes resilience and sustainability with a strong focus on strategies for economically integrating high levels of distributed renewable energy generation such as solar photovoltaic, wind, and small hydroelectric.\nExplores concepts and best practices through extensive real-world examples, including site visits to numerous operational microgrid systems.\nProvides insights from experts who design, build, and operate some of the most innovative and advanced microgrids in the world.\nEstablishes a strong foundation of what to consider at all stages of developing a microgrid project, including flexible and iterative approaches to project conceptualization, data collection, design, and modeling.\n\nAlaska is an early adopter of microgrids that integrate renewable energy due to economic necessity, with over 100 systems representing the largest installed capacity of any U.S. state. Alaska is home to microgrids that are constantly evolving to take advantage of new technologies and integration approaches. The University of Alaska Fairbanks works closely with communities, utilities, and developers across the state \u2013 and around the world \u2013 in designing and developing robust, cost-effective, and resilient energy solutions based on distributed energy resources (DER) and microgrid system architectures.\nSpecific real-world systems that will be explored include:\n\nKodiak Island, Alaska is a community of approximately 10,000 residents that has systematically transitioned to 100% renewable energy from a combination of resources including wind turbines and hydroelectric power coupled with a flywheel and battery (Li-ion) storage system.\nCordova, Alaska is a fishing community with highly variable and seasonal industrial loads striving to transition to 100% renewable energy using a combination of run-of-river hydroelectric, energy storage, EVs, and hierarchical control strategies using smart grid enabling technologies.\nKongiganak, Alaska is a small Yupik Eskimo community that has developed an innovative wind-based microgrid system that uses real-time response algorithms to manage dispatchable thermal loads to achieve 100% wind energy penetration for significant periods of time.\nKotzebue, Alaska is an Inupiat Eskimo community that has over two decades of experience in wind and solar PV development. Kotzebue has taken a holistic approach to energy management that extends from investment in EVs to making ice for local fishermen using absorption refrigeration.\nKing Island, Australia is home to a highly innovative microgrid system, owned and operated by Hydro Tasmania. The system combines nearly 3 MW of solar and wind with a range of innovative supporting technologies. The system is capable of 100% renewable operation, and supplies over 65% of King Island\u2019s annual energy needs using renewable energy.\nHawaii is a U.S. leader in the integration of variable renewable energy, with a goal to generate 100 percent clean energy by 2045. While some of Hawaii\u2019s individual island grids are too big to typically be categorized as microgrids, several microgrids have been installed at military bases and commercial and industrial sites. There are many lessons learned from Hawaii\u2019s experience with both microgrids and regional grids that are transferable to similar small grid architectures. \nFairbanks, Alaska is our hometown, but also home to some unique energy systems that support a very large multi-community microgrid operated by Golden Valley Electric Association with some unique features, including a very large battery energy storage system coupled with a flywheel.",

This allows them to successfully complete projects on time and on budget and achieve successful results.\nLinked to the Technical skill area of the PMI Talent Triangle\u00ae, this course focuses on the technical aspects of successfully managing projects. Topics will delve into the core skills of scope, cost, and schedule management and integrating these concepts to develop a master project plan. Participants will also need to demonstrate an understanding of quality, risk, and procurement management and use techniques such as earned value, critical path methodology, and general data gathering and analysis techniques. \nThis course focuses on the technical skills of successfully managing projects. Topics will include:\n\n\nEstimating\n\n\nReviewing project management methods\n\n\nPlanning for scope, schedule and cost throughout a project\n\n\nDemonstrating some understanding of quality improvement, risk management, and procurement management\n\n\nApplying the concepts of earned value analysis and critical path scheduling technique.\n\n\nRegardless of the type of project you're working on, staying up to date with proven methods to manage your projects will allow you to get work done as effectively and efficiently as possible. The flexibility demonstrated through implementation of these tools allows project managers to switch between traditional methods when needed or gain new ways of working for different projects.\nMaking the switch from \u201ctraditional\u201d project management to agile is not always straightforward, and it can be particularly challenging for organizations who are accustomed to a predictive environment. However, with the right guidance and support, the transition doesn't have to be overwhelming. This course will help learners gain valuable insight into applying the adaptive techniques (iterative, incremental, or agile) that can make the transition smoother should you choose to do so in your real world projects. Adaptive techniques may feel unfamiliar and cumbersome at first, but with an open mind and some perseverance, the rewards can be great.\nBy the end of the course, you will be exposed to the tools and techniques to ensure your projects are utilizing the most appropriate methods, tools, and techniques that meet the needs of your project\u2013and meet the expectations of your stakeholders. Learners will discover that project managers can quickly adapt to any new situation they face by focusing on the goals they want to achieve and the value they expect to deliver. They should embrace change and recognize that there will always be new ideas, methods, and technology available for them to adopt.\nAdditionally, upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 8 contact hours of project management education which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). A total of 35 contact hours in project management education are a requirement to those looking to achieve the Project Management Professional (PMP\u00ae)certification. Learners will finish this course with increased knowledge of the better practice tips to engage stakeholders and be more than ready to continue their project management and PMP\u00ae journey, which we hope completes your certificate with us.",

Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways.\nThe course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:\nA global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.\nA foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.\nAn ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities.\nA sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world\u2019s poorest and suffering people.",

Maybe you admire works by directors such as Wong Kar Wai.\nWhatever you know and wherever you are we invite you to join us on a journey to consider how the local and the global intersect to make Hong Kong cinema an integral part of popular culture around the world as well as a leading force in the development of world cinematic art.\nIn this course you\u2019ll learn how flows of capital, people, technologies, ideas and creativity circulate and shape the cultural industry of filmmaking, resulting in transnational co-productions and cross-cultural co-operations. You\u2019ll see how these dynamic processes are inflected in characterization, plot development, and space-time configurations on Hong Kong screens.\nOur location in the cultural crossroads of Hong Kong allows us to introduce you to film professionals such as director Mabel Cheung and Andrew Lau, producer John Sham, film festival director Roger Garcia, and other guests, talking candidly about the industry.\nDuring your weeks with us you\u2019ll see demonstrations of martial arts choreography, participate in close analysis of film techniques, investigate Hong Kong global stardom, uncover the reasons for the worldwide appeal of genres such as the kung fu film, and nurture a comparative and critical understanding of issues of gender, race, migration. Best of all you\u2019ll partner with leading researchers in the field to appreciate Hong Kong\u2019s contribution to world cinema.\nPlease watch these films so that you can get the most out of the course content. Please note that you will need to acquire and watch the films on your own. We advise you see the films before each week\u2019s material.\nHere is the list of films for each week.\nWeek 1 \u2013 any Jackie Chan film (optional)\nWeek 2 \u2013 any Bruce Lee film (optional), but we suggest Fist of Fury / The Chinese Connection (dir.

We will conceptualize the role historical and affective turning points continue to play in the selection, interpretation and valuation of these writings.\nTogether we will propose continuities and discontinuities between these historical literary works and the present. Along the way we will construct global and temporal mappings between a set of seemingly disparate locations, myths, and traditions.\nVia the of the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain we will explore literary, political and historical context, their desire to create a distinctively national literature, and the ongoing controversy over the local, national, and transnational significance of this literature.",

TDD tests individual units of code while BDD tests how these units work together.\nThis course introduces you to the fundamentals of both TDD and BDD, You\u2019ll discover what automated testing is and why it is essential for building robust applications resilient to failure. You'll explore the basics of testing, including test cases, testing levels, the traditional release cycle, and the benefits, concepts and popular tools involved.\nThis course provides multiple real-world inspired hands-on labs to demonstrate your skills with TDD and BDD. You\u2019ll create TDD test cases by writing test assertions and building test fixtures, and you\u2019ll run these test cases using the Nose testing package. You\u2019ll practice more advanced TDD methods, such as increasing code coverage, generating and using fake data, and testing mock objects. You\u2019ll also practice setting up a BDD environment using Behave, write the feature and step files, test a web interface using Selenium, and load sample data for testing.\nBy the end of the course you will have the knowledge and skills to perform test driven development (TDD) and behavior driven development (BDD) testing and understand when to apply these development techniques.",

    "course_description": "Communication complexity rapidly increases even with a few program or project team members and stakeholders. Project managers are the \u201chub\u201d of their project communication. Program managers are the \u201chub\u201d of their organization communication to meet strategic goals. Managing these networks is essential whether you manage traditional programs or projects. Or agile programs and projects.\nProgram managers have two additional challenges. First, they must empower their project managers with skills, processes, and assets for information management. Second they must sense and integrate the key performance data to ensure strategic objectives are met, and project processes are improved across the program. \nAs you learned from the Project Management Institute, Inc.'s (PMI)\"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge\" (PMBOK) when preparing for the PMP exam, the number of communication channels grows geometrically with team size. If there are \u201cn\u201d communicators, then the number of communication channels is n*(n-1)/2. That means five team members have 10 channels, but 10 team members have 45 channels to manage. That\u2019s over four times as many channels for doubling the size of a small team! \nIf you imagine each communication channel as a radio station, you can see how quickly the program or project manager can be overwhelmed with all the information coming in. As you gain more program or project management experience, what you learned for the PMP certification or similar professional certification is not sufficient. This course will help you go beyond the knowledge you needed to become a certified project manager. \nThis applies to all project leaders. Whether you are a just getting started as a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), or a seasoned Project Management Professional (PMP), you need to manage a lot of information transfer and exchange. And this challenge is even greater for agilists, like certified scrum masters (CSMs) and PMI-ACP holders. No matter the scaling methods, having timely information is critical for agile teams at scale, who need to move fast without driving up overhead in team-to-team communication as technical scope changes. \nIn this program and project management training course, you will learn effective and efficient project management tools to receive and transmit program and project-level information. Program managers and project managers need to ensure that information flows freely and where the information can do the most benefit. This online course will teach you how to build communication networks for your program or project\u2019s success. Gain 10 professional development units (PDUs) while sharpening your program or project management skills.",

    "course_description": "Plasma, the fourth state of matter, is by far the most abundant form of known matter in the universe. Its behavior is very different from the other states of matter we are usually familiar with. To understand it, a rigorous formalism is required. This is essential not only to explain important astrophysical phenomena, but also to optimize many industrial and medical applications and for achieving fusion energy on Earth.\nThis physics course, taught by world-renowned experts of the field, gives you the opportunity to acquire a basic knowledge of plasma physics. A rigorous introduction to the plasma state will be followed by a description of the models, from single particle, to kinetic and fluid, which can be applied to study its dynamics. You will learn about the waves that can exist in a plasma and how to mathematically describe them, how a plasma can be controlled by magnetic fields, and how its complex and fascinating behavior is simulated using today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\nThis course is the first of two courses introducing plasma physics and its applications. After completing this course, you will have the prerequisites to enjoy Plasma Physics: Applications, which deals with plasma applications in astrophysics, industry, medicine, nuclear fusion and laser-plasma interaction.",

No need to install anything! \nYou will learn how to write your own functions (just like functions in mathematics for example). You will also gain insight into a computer's architecture and learn how its memory is organized. \nGiven the vast amount of memory computers have these days, how does your program remember where a certain variable is stored? This brings about the important topic of how memory is efficiently addressed inside a computer, and with it, the topic of pointers. \nPointers are often considered the most difficult part and main struggle for C program developers. We will introduce you to this central topic with our novel and innovative visualization tools and show you precisely how pointers work. No need to struggle! \nThe programming concepts you will gain in this course are foundational to any programming language. \nBy the end of this short course, you willhave reached the third milestonein the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate program, unlocking the door to a career in computer engineering. \nThis course has received financial support from the Patrick & Lina Drahi Foundation.",
